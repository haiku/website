# Xz: malicious code in distributed source

* Date: 2024-03-30
* Severity: Critical
* Type: Authentication bypass / Remote code execution
* Source: [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3094)
* Communication: Mailing Lists - haiku,haiku-developers,[haiku-security](https://freelists.org/post/haiku-security/NOTICE-Major-CVE-backdoor-in-xz-utils5611,1)

## Description

Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with version 5.6.0. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.

## Impacts

While Haiku users may not be directly impacted given the Linux target for this backdoor, it's recommended to upgrade to a unaffected version as soon as possible.  Haiku will closely monitor updates from the Xz team and take recommended actions.
