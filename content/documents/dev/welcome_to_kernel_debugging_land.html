                    <p>One of the most important tools of a Haiku kernel developer is the built-in
kernel debugger. Nevertheless also developers more comfortable with userland
hacking should not be shy to use it, as it can greatly help with various kinds
of bugs and problems. This document sheds some light on its basic and advanced
features.</p>

<h3>In and Out</h3>

<p>Unless the system entered KDL by itself, you can normally do that by 
invoking the keyboard shortcut Alt-SysReq-D. Note that in KDL your 
keyboard may not work. PS/2 keyboards always do, USB keyboards connected
via UHCI controllers do only, if one has entered KDL via the keyboard
shortcut at least once. USB OHCI is not supported at the moment.
</p>

<p>Once the kernel debugger is running, the normal activities of the system are
completely halted. Until it is exited, no thread will make any progress on any
CPU, and hardware interrupts are disabled. So while in KDL (Kernel Debugging
Land) one can leisurely examine an unmoving snapshot of the whole system.
After using one of the commands to leave the kernel debugger
(<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #0000ff;">continue</span></code></span>, <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #0000dd;">exit</span></code></span>, <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">es</code></span>), the system
continues its normal operation. If it had encountered
a serious problem before (like a page fault in the kernel), the odds are that
it will immediately drop back into KDL, though. In this case the commands
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">reboot</code></span> or <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">shutdown</code></span> are the only way out. They
cannot shutdown the system orderly though, meaning that data not written back
to disk yet will be lost.</p>

<h3>The Basic Infrastructure</h3>

<h4>Command Line Editing and Output</h4>

<p>The kernel debugger has a simple command line interface. One can enter a
command, and, after it has been executed, one is prompted for the next input.
Basic command line editing is supported, that is HOME, END, the Cursor
Left/Right keys, as well as DELETE and BACKSPACE work as expected. Ctrl-K clears
the line beginning at the cursor position.
Even a short command history is available. Cursor Up/Down navigate through
the previously entered commands. Page Up/Down move to the previous/next line
in the history that starts with the characters before the cursor.</p>

<p>Pressing TAB after typing a part of a command name will try to complete the
name of the command, if possible. Ambiguities will be pointed out. Pressing TAB
when the cursor is positioned after the command name and the space following it
will invoke the command with the argument <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">--</span>help</code></span>, which will, in
most cases, print usage information for the command. Editing of the command
line can then be continued.</p>

<p>The way the text that has been printed "scrolls", when the bottom of the
screen is reached, needs some getting used to, since it doesn't scroll at all,
but the cursor simply wraps around to the top of the screen, overwriting the
oldest output. By default the output of a debugger command stops just before
it overwrites what it has printed before, waiting for a key to be pressed
before continuing. Pressing Q will cause the remaining output of that command
to be discarded silently. The <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">paging</code></span> command toggles whether the
output stops in such cases or continues without asking the user.</p>

<h4>Help</h4>

<p>When looking for a command with a certain functionality without knowing its
name, the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">help</code></span> command can actually help. It lists all available
commands, each with a short description. Giving <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">help</code></span> the first
characters of a command name, the list will be restricted to the matching
commands (e.g. "<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">help a</code></span>" lists all commands starting with "a").</p>

<p>A growing number of commands support being invoked with the argument
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">--</span>help</code></span>. Those that do print a more detailed description how
they can be used. As mentioned before, pressing TAB while editing the command
line for such a command will print that info, too.</p>

<h4>A Simple Calculator</h4>

<p>Since kernel debugger sessions often involve lots of numbers flying around,
basic arithmetic expressions are supported. The <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">expr</code></span> command
will evaluate them for you and print the result.</p>

<pre>
kdebug> expr (0x898afe36 + 17 * 4 - 0x8014d184) / 32
4960615 (0x4bb167)
</pre>

<p>Internally the numbers are represented as unsigned 64 bit integer values (and
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">expr</code></span> prints them that way), which means that negative numbers
are shown as huge positive numbers. Most operations involving negatives work
fine nonetheless, exceptions are division (<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">/</span></code></span>) and modulo
(<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">%</span></code></span>).</p>

<pre>
kdebug> expr 7 + 3 * -4
18446744073709551611 (0xfffffffffffffffb)
kdebug> expr -(7 + 3 * -4)
5 (0x5)
kdebug> expr -6 / -3
0 (0x0)
</pre>

<p>People familiar with the C language will know the unary <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">*</span></code></span> operator.
It dereferences a given address pointer, i.e. looks up the value that is stored
at that address. The kernel debugger supports that operator, too. By default
it reads four bytes at the given address and interprets them as a number, but
the number of bytes to be read (1, 2, 4, or 8) can be specified explicitely
in curly braces. An error message will be printed, when trying to dereference
an address that does not exist.</p>

<pre>
kdebug> expr *0x80000000
1179403647 (0x464c457f)
kdebug> expr *{2}0x80000000
17791 (0x457f)
kdebug> expr *0x17
failed to dereference address 0x00000017, at position: 0, in expression: *0x17
</pre>


<p>While it is nice to be able to print the value of an arithmetic expression,
it is often not necessary to do that, since one usually just wants to pass
the value to a command, and the value of an expression can be provided
as an argument to a command by simply putting that expression in parentheses.
For example the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">db</code></span> command, which takes an address and a number
of bytes and prints that many bytes read from the memory starting at the given
address, can be invoked like this:</p>

<pre>
kdebug> db (0x80000000 + 100) (6 * 4)
[0x80000064]  ................   09 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
[0x80000074]  ........           01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
</pre>

<h4>Variables</h4>

<p>Since it's not possible to scroll the output on the screen, values that
might be of interest later will probably already be overwritten when they are
needed. Fortunately variables can be defined to hold values for later use.
They can be set by the assignment operator (<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000080;">=</span></code></span>), modified by the
operators <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">+</span><span style="color: #000080;">=</span></code></span>, <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">-</span><span style="color: #000080;">=</span></code></span>, <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">*</span><span style="color: #000080;">=</span></code></span>, <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">/</span><span style="color: #000080;">=</span></code></span>,
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">%</span><span style="color: #000080;">=</span></code></span>, and unset via <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">unset</code></span>. The <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">vars</code></span>
command prints all variables that are defined.</p>

<pre>
kdebug> a = 7
kdebug> b = 3 + a
kdebug> a -= 2
kdebug> expr c = b - a
5 (0x5)
kdebug> unset a
kdebug> vars
               b: 10 (0xa)
               c: 5 (0x5)
         _thread: 2148328320 (0x800ce380)
       _threadID: 1 (0x1)
           _team: 2424574464 (0x90841200)
         _teamID: 1 (0x1)
            _cpu: 0 (0x0)
               _: 5 (0x5)
</pre>

<p>In the example several additional variables with a name starting with an
underscore are listed. Those are called temporary variables and in this case
(except <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_</code></span>) they have been set automatically when the kernel debugger
was entered. <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_thread</code></span> is the pointer to the current thread's
kernel internal management structure, <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_threadID</code></span> its ID,
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_team</code></span> the current team's kernel structure, <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_teamID</code></span>
its ID, and <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_cpu</code></span> the index of the CPU the kernel debugger is
running on.</p>

<p>Several commands also set temporary variables as a side effect, e.g.
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">sem</code></span>, which prints information about a semaphore, also sets
the variable <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_owner</code></span> (the ID of the team owning the semaphore)
and others. The temporary variable <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_</code></span> is by convention used as
the return value of a command (if it has one). In the example above
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">expr</code></span> set it to 5, which was the value of the expression it
evaluated.</p>

<p>The number of temporary variables is limited. When the limit has been
reached and another variable is defined, the least recently used variable
is evicted automatically. This holds only for temporary variables, though;
non temporary variables have a limit too, but they are fully controlled by the
user. When that limit is hit, no new variable can be defined until another one
has been <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">unset</code></span> explicitly.</p>


<h3>The Most Popular Commmands</h3>

<h4><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">sc</code></span></h4>

<p><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">sc</code></span> ("stack crawl"), alias <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">bt</code></span> ("back trace"), alias
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">where</code></span>, prints a stack trace of the thread with the given ID or the
address of the thread's kernel structure. With no argument given, the current
thread on the current CPU is selected.</p>

<p>The stack trace is so interesting, because it shows exactly in which function
the thread is currently, from what function that function has been called, and
so on. Also shown are the addresses of the so called stack frames, which are
the base addresses of the respective functions' parameters and local
variables.</p>

<p>Roughly in the middle the example stack trace above is interrupted by an
iframe (interrupt frame). An iframe ends up on the stack when a userland
thread performs a syscall (system call), or an exception (page fault,
division by zero) or a hardware interrupt occurs. The bottommost iframe shown
for a userland thread is always the one for the transition to the kernel.
In the example we can see that it happened due to a hardware interrupt, which
is unsurprising as it was caused by pressing the Alt-SysReq-D combo. An iframe captures
the processor registers at the time, so together with a disassembly of the
respective function it is possible to reconstruct, what exactly is happening
there.</p>

<h4><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">teams</code></span></h4>

<p><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">teams</code></span> lists all existing teams, with their name, ID, and parent
team.</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>Usually this is the first command used, when looking for a problem in a
certain program, since the listing yields its team ID.</p>

<h4><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">threads</code></span></h4>

<p><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">threads</code></span> lists all threads of a specified team, or all existing
threads, if no argument is given.</p>

<pre>
kdebug> threads 78

</pre>

<p>For each thread a compact one line info is printed. It consists of the
thread's kernel structure pointer, its ID, current state (running, waiting,
etc.), the ID of the semaphore or condition variable it is currently waiting
on (if any), and other info.</p>

<h4><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">sem</code></span></h4>

<p><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">sem</code></span> prints information about a semaphore, which can be specified
by ID, address of its kernel structure, or by name (though semaphore names need
not be unique).
</p>

<pre>
debug> sem 2768
SEM: 0x9930e700
id:      2768 (0xad0)
name:    'AppLooperPort'
owner:   -1
count:   -1
queue:   78
last acquired by: 78, count: 1
last released by: 78, count: 1
</pre>

<p>Of special interest, particularly when analyzing deadlock situations, are
the "last acquired" and "last released" rows. "last acquired" shows the ID of
the thread that last acquired the semaphore successfully. This number is
negated, if the semaphore was released afterwards. In a case of deadlock looking
what the last acquiring thread is doing, will usually give some clue about
what's the problem. In a simple situation, it would wait for a semaphore that
the first thread acquired last.</p>

<p>Userland deadlocks involving benaphore-style <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLocker</code></span>s (the
default) can't be analyzed that easily, since the respective sempahores will
not have been acquired by the threads holding the locks. In most cases stack
traces of the team's threads will help understanding those deadlocks as well,
though.</p>


<h3>Kernel Tracing</h3>

<p>A quite powerful debugging feature of the Haiku kernel is kernel tracing.
The kernel can reserve a specified amount of memory as tracing buffer and
use it to record information when certain events occur. In the kernel
debugger the recorded entries can be filtered and printed, thus providing
an analysis tool for tracking down bugs and other problems. One of the great
advantages of kernel tracing over usual debug output into a file or via a
serial connection is that it comes with a significantly lower performance
penalty, which in most cases is in fact even less than the error of
measurement. Also very nice is, that the data are available right in the
kernel debugger, so that one can analyze them in combination with the halted
system.</p>

<h4>Enabling It</h4>

<p>Kernel tracing is a compile time feature, that is it has to be enabled when
building Haiku. This can be done in the header file
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">build<span style="color: #000040;">/</span>user_config_headers<span style="color: #000040;">/</span>tracing_config.<span style="color: #007788;">h</span></code></span> (create the folder and copy <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">build<span style="color: #000040;">/</span>config_headers<span style="color: #000040;">/</span>tracing_config.<span style="color: #007788;">h</span></code></span> which contains the default settings) by changing the value of
the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">ENABLE_TRACING</code></span> macro to the value <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #0000dd;">1</span></code></span>. Furthermore
one needs to specify, what kinds of information shall be traced, which is done
by setting the respective macros to a value greater than 0:</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLOCK_CACHE_TRANSACTION_TRACING</code></span></dt>
<dd>Enables tracing of block cache transactions. This is most likely only of
interest for developers trying to track down block cache or file system
bugs.</dd>

<dt><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BMESSAGE_TRACING</code></span></dt>
<dd>Enables tracing of BMessage sending. Whenever a BMessage is sent,
the message destination (team, port, token), the delivery method (direct,
remote), and the message's "what" field will be recorded.</dd>

<dt><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">KERNEL_HEAP_TRACING</code></span></dt>

<p>The <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">MAX_TRACE_SIZE</code></span> macro defines the size of the tracing
buffer (in bytes). The default of 1 MB is a little tight, if a lot of
information is recorded. The tracing buffer is a ring buffer, i.e. when full
it will start overwriting the oldest entries.</p>

<h4>The <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> Command</h4>

<p>The <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> kernel debugger command prints the recorded tracing
information. Since usually there will be many recorded entries, there are
several parameters to specify which subset shall be printed. The entries in
the tracing buffer are indexed; the oldest one in the buffer has index 1.
The first parameter of <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> is the index of an entry and the
second parameter the number of entries to be printed.</p>

</pre>

<p>The common information listed for each entry are the index, (in square
brackets) the ID of the thread logging the entry, and the system time (in
microseconds) when the entry was logged. The following data are specific to the
type of the entry. A final line at the end of the listing tells us how many
entries have been printed and from what index range (later examples will show
that these information are not always that obvious), as well as how many entries
are currently in the buffer and how many have been logged so far.</p>

<p>The second parameter to the command can be omitted; it defaults to 30.
If given and negative, it changes the meaning of the first parameter. Instead
of specifying the first entry to print, it will refer to the last one, and the
negated value of the second parameter defines the number of entries to list.</p>

printed 5 entries within range 116 to 120 (5 of 20655 total, 189725 ever)
</pre>

<p>A special value for the first parameter is 0 (or any negative value). It
refers to the last entry in the buffer, and furthermore causes the second
parameter to be interpreted as if negative. This makes it easy to print the
last recorded entries.</p>

<p>Looking through tens or hundreds of thousands entries using
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> with only those two parameters is quite impractical.
Hence there's a simple but powerful filter mechanism. A filter is passed to
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> as a list of additional parameters preceded by the keyword
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">filter</code></span>. It can consist of several basic filters which can be
combined via boolean operators to a complex expression. Those operators are
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">and</code></span>, <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">or</code></span>, and <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">not</code></span>, and they are used
in prefix notation, meaning that the operator comes first and is followed by
its one respectively two arguments. This needs a little getting used to, but
has the advantages that it doesn't require parentheses (which are already
reserved for numeric kernel debugger expressions) and that it keeps parsing
very simple. The basic filters are:
</p>

<dl>
<dl>
<dt><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">thread <span style="color: #000080;">&lt;</span>thread id<span style="color: #000080;">&gt;</span></code></span></dt>
<dd>Matches those entries recorded by the thread with the specified ID.</dd>

<dt><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">team <span style="color: #000080;">&lt;</span>team id<span style="color: #000080;">&gt;</span></code></span></dt>
<dd>Matches those entries recorded by a thread of the team with the
specified ID.</dd>

<dt><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #339900;">#&lt;pattern&gt;</span></code></span></dt>
<dd>Matches those entries whose printed representation contains the
specified case-sensitive pattern (actually not a real pattern, just a string).
If the string contains spaces it must be put in quotes (including the
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #339900;">#</span></code></span>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>Very useful in combination with filters is the optional third numeric
parameter of <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span>. It specifies how many entries shall at most
be searched for matches (as opposed to the second parameter which limits the
number of entries to be printed). If omitted the same value as given for the
second parameter is used. The special value -1 means that all entries in the
buffer shall be searched, which is usually what one wants, but can potentially
take a long time, when the tracing buffer is large and contains many entries.
In the following example we search for entries from the team 41 containing the
text "BMessage", printing five at a time at maximum.</p>

</pre>

<p>The example also shows another feature of the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> command.
When invoked without any parameters it continues the search of the previous
invocation. In this case the search continues backward (start index 0 implies
backward search), still listing at most five entries at a time. In this form
(and only in this form) <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> is continuable, meaning that just
hitting enter will invoke it again. This makes browsing through entries quite
convenient.</p>

<p><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> supports some switch options which can be given before
the first numerical argument. One is <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">--</span>printteam</code></span> which causes the
ID of the team that logged the entry to be printed as well (after colon in the
square brackets). When <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #000040;">--</span><span style="color: #0000dd;">difftime</span></code></span> is specified only for the first
entry the absolute system time is printed. For subsequent entries the time
difference to the previously printed entry will be shown. While this is not
exactly a profiling option, it can at least be used to get a first
impression.</p>

<h3>An Example Debug Session</h3>

<p>The previous sections introduced all that is needed to hunt down quite a
variety of bugs and problems. Not in all cases the kernel debugger is the
best choice, though. For easily reproducible bugs in userland applications simple
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp"><span style="color: #0000dd;">printf</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span> debugging or using gdb as a source level debugger might be
a better choice. Some problems, however -- particularly ones that are hard to
reproduce, lead to situations that make userland debugging impossible (e.g. when
not being able to start the Terminal anymore), or are race conditions that
disappear when adding too much debug output -- can often better be analyzed
with the kernel debugger.</p>

<p>This section documents a debug session that uncovers
<a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1745">bug #1745</a> which occurs
in revision 23864. It's the first
time I encountered the bug and, thanks to always having kernel tracing enabled
for syscalls, signals, teams, and <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BMessage</code></span>s, all the information
needed for the analysis were already available. The symptoms of the bug are that
right after booting the Deskbar hangs and Tracker doesn't even show up.
Here we go...</p>

<p>The semaphore the window thread is waiting for belongs to the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BWindow</code></span>
lock. The thread is in the window's message dispatcher loop, trying to lock
the window, so that it can dispatch the next message. Someone else already has
the lock and apparently doesn't release it. Unfortunately the lock in question
is a benaphore-style BLocker, so that <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">sem</code></span>s "last acquired" output
usually isn't of much help. In this case it shows thread 69, Tracker's main
thread, as last acquirer. It may or may not be the actual owner of the lock; at
any rate it doesn't harm to have a closer look what the thread is up to:</p>

<p>Currently it is obviously waiting for a synchronous reply to a message
it just sent (<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">_user_port_buffer_size_etc<span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span> in the kernel part of
the stack trace). The stack trace also shows that the thread is still in the

This is at least a good reason to lock the window. So who doesn't reply to the
message?</p>

<p>... the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLooperList</code></span> lock. The <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLooperList</code></span> is a list
of all <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLooper</code></span>s of a team. It's main purpose is to allow the
invocation of certain methods (<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">Lock<span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span>,
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">PostMessage<span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span>) on <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLooper</code></span> pointers that are not
necessarily valid anymore.
Those methods simply look up the pointer in the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLooperList</code></span> before
doing anything with it that might cause an invalid memory access. The
list is protected by a lock, which must be held when working with the list and
also can be held for a short time to ensure that no looper will be deleted during
that time. The lock is an innermost lock, however, i.e. while holding it no
other lock may be acquired in order to prevent potential deadlocks. Being a
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLocker</code></span> and thus supporting nested locking, it is also clear that
none of the threads waiting for the lock is its current owner, which leaves only
the Deskbar main thread. Let's see, what it is doing and why it is waiting:</p>

<p>According to the stack trace the thread is trying to send a message.
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">traced</code></span> tells us that it is a "direct" (i.e. intra-application)
message to port 16474, which belongs to the "Deskbar" window. Intra-app
messages are not really sent to a port, though. Instead they are directly
added to the target's message queue. The semaphore the thread is waiting for
belongs to that <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BMessageQueue</code></span>. First of all, looking through the
source code of the functions listed in the stack trace, reveals where the
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLooperList</code></span> lock is being held although it shouldn't:</p>

<pre>
BLooper::_PostMessage(BMessage *msg, BHandler *handler,
    BHandler *replyTo)
{
    AutoLocker&lt;BLooperList> listLocker(gLooperList);
    if (!listLocker.IsLocked())
        return B_ERROR;

    if (!gLooperList.IsLooperValid(this))
        return B_BAD_VALUE;

    // Does handler belong to this looper?
    if (handler && handler->Looper() != this)
        return B_MISMATCHED_VALUES;

    status_t status;
    BMessenger messenger(handler, this, &status);
    if (status == B_OK)
        status = messenger.SendMessage(msg, replyTo, 0);

    return status;
}
</pre>

<p>The lock is held until the end of the method, including the line where
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">messenger.<span style="color: #007788;">SendMessage</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span> is called. This is a bug -- the lock must
be released after the construction of the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BMessenger</code></span> at the
latest.</p>

<p>This is only one problem, though. Just as the <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLooperList</code></span> lock a
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BMessageQueue</code></span> lock should not be held while trying to acquire
another lock. That is the main thread should not block on such a lock for a
long time, since the owner should release it eventually. Aside from direct
message deliveries, the message queue is normally only used within the looper it
belongs to. So it's likely that in this case the window thread is holding it
although it ought not to:</p>

<p>After browsing through the source code of the functions listed in the stack
trace, the erroneous code appears to be in
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BWindow<span style="color: #008080;">::</span><span style="color: #007788;">UpdateIfNeeded</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span>:</p>

<pre>
    BMessageQueue *queue = MessageQueue();
    queue->Lock();

    // First process and remove any _UPDATE_ message in the queue
    // With the current design, there can only be one at a time

    BMessage *msg;
    for (int32 i = 0; (msg = queue->FindMessage(i)) != NULL; i++) {
        if (msg->what == _UPDATE_) {
            BWindow::DispatchMessage(msg, this);
                // we need to make sure that no overridden method is called
                // here; for BWindow::DispatchMessage() we now exactly what
                // will happen
            queue->RemoveMessage(msg);
            delete msg;
            break;
                // NOTE: "i" would have to be decreased if there were
                // multiple _UPDATE_ messages and we would not break!
        }
    }

    queue->Unlock();
</pre>

<p><span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BWindow<span style="color: #008080;">::</span><span style="color: #007788;">DispatchMessage</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span> is invoked while holding the message
queue lock. <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">DispatchMessage<span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span> calls various functions, including
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BView<span style="color: #008080;">::</span><span style="color: #007788;">Draw</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span> which can be overridden by application developers. So,
although the comment in <span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">UpateIfNeeded<span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span> suggests that calling
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">DispatchMessage<span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span></code></span> is OK, it definitely is not.</p>

<p>To sum up our findings: Tracker hangs because it's still in its
initialization phase and waits forever for a reply message from the Deskbar.
The Deskbar in turn has run into a standard deadlock with the
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="cpp geshifilter-cpp">BLooperList</code></span> lock and the deskbar window's message queue lock
involved. Main and window thread mutually wait for the lock the respective
other thread holds.</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Haiku's kernel debugger is a powerful tool whose usefulness does not end in
the kernel domain. It can also help with certain userland problems, that would
otherwise be tricky to tackle. This document gave an introduction to the basic
features of the kernel debugger, its most commonly used commands, and the kernel
tracing mechanism. It concluded with a documented debug session showing how
to apply the previously presented information to track down a bug in practice.
</p>

<p>I hope after reading this document, Haiku developers feel encouraged to
also consider whether using the kernel debugger could lead them quicker to a
solution when they face a problem in Haiku. Particularly keeping the
inexpensive kernel tracing enabled at all times might provide helpful
information right when it's needed.</p>
