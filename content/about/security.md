We take the security of our infrastructure and operating system seriously.
Personal data is an important resource, and we want to ensure users can place their trust in Haiku.

## Haiku Infrastructure

Our infrastructure contains sensitive personal user data, and we aggressively keep this information private on a need-to-know basis at all times.

If you have discovered a vulnerability, CVE, or exploit that you believe puts user data at risk, please submit a detailed report to contact@haiku-inc.org. [Haiku, Inc.](http://haiku-inc.org) will ensure a rapid response from our infrastructure / sysadmin team.

Our infrastructure team will correct the vulnerability, and work with Haiku, Inc. to disclose the scope of the breach to the impacted users.

## Haiku (the operating system)

While Haiku is under heavy development, we still desire to create a secure operating system free of any major vulnerabilities. Our developers on the [development mailing list](/community/ml)  would be interested in discussing any security issues within Haiku.

## Haikuports (ported software)

Any serious vulnerabilities should be reported to the [Haikuports issue tracker](https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/issues)

## Disclosure

Any critical vulnerabilities with a CVE attached impacting Haiku will be disclosed on our [website](/security), and via our [haiku-security mailing list](/community/ml).
