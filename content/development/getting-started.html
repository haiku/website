The information on this page is intended to explain how you can get started with Haiku development.

<h3>Getting Involved</h3>
The best way to get into developing on the Haiku project is to get to know the
environment and make yourself familiar with the system. If you have programmed
for BeOS before, getting into the Haiku API shouldn't be a problem. If you are
new to Haiku, try spending some time with easier tasks (see below).
It is much easier for us to help you with problems you encounter after you
chose a task than to assign one to you as we don't know what your exact skills
and preferences are.

<h3>Easy Introductory Tasks</h3>
Here are a few possible starting points:
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Fix font sensitivity issues and hard-coded values</strong><br>
		Run apps, see if everything looks alright at different font sizes, fix any
		bugs. Check the source for use of hard-coded values (e.g., colors, paths) and
		use the respective API call to retrieve the system-defined value (e.g., via
		ui_color()).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Make our UI and applications more compliant to our HIG</strong><br>
		Run apps, check if menus and buttons are named and positioned correctly
		(e.g., menus/buttons that open a dialog should end with "..." using
		B_UTF8_ELLIPSIS). Also, check, for example, if the preferences dialogs apply
		changes immediately (or have an "Apply" button) and if they have a "Revert"
		button (instead of "Cancel" and "OK"). Also see if they behave consistently
		with the rest of our system preferences applications.<br>
		See the <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/HIG/index.xml">
		Human Interface Guidelines</a> for further information on this item.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cleanup incompliant source files</strong><br>
		We have <a href="/development/coding-guidelines">
		Coding Guidelines</a> that all of our source should follow (except for
		imported code from other projects). Some of the native applications do not
		follow these guidelines yet. Clean them up so they are compliant and submit
		a patch to our <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/">
		bug tracker</a> as an enhancement ticket.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Easy tasks from our bugtracker</strong><br>
		Please also take a look at our <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/EasyTasks">
		list of easy tasks</a> at the bugtracker. They are mostly smaller bugs that can
		be fixed by one person. Pick one of them, leave a comment that you are working
		on it and attach a patch when you're done.
	</li>
</ul>
<br>
If you don't find something for you in this list, please ask at our development mailing
list by sending in a small introduction of yourself:
<ul>
	<li>
		What are your skills? - E.g.: "I'm a professional C++ developer." or "I'm
		a hobby coder with 2 years C++ experience."
	</li>
	<li>
		How many hour per week do you want to work? A rough estimate is enough,
		just so that we can assess which kind of task may fit you.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do you have experience with special development areas? - E.g.: kernel,
		network, file systems...
	</li>
	<li>
		Is there some specific area you want to work on?
	</li>
</ul>
We will try to find something for you by asking some questions and maybe
pointing you to specific bugs.

<h3>When You've Found a Task</h3>
When you have found a task you'd like to work on, please feel free to ask
your questions on the development mailing list. Before writing code please
also read our Coding Guidelines and try to always keep them in mind (we are
strict about them). Then we wish you much luck and fun coding for Haiku!

<h3><a name="development_tools" title="development_tools"></a>What do I need for coding?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Currently, Haiku is the best development environment.
		Linux, BSD, and OS X also work.  
                BeOS, Zeta, Cygwin, and Solaris are no longer actively maintained as development environments and little to no support is offered for those platforms.

<h3>Obtaining Git write access</h3>

<p>Write access to the Haiku repository is granted to developers on the basis of their contributions to the Haiku code base. Your shortest way to obtaining write access is by submitting patches using our <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org">Trac bug reporting tool</a>.</p>

<p>After a number of your patches have been successfully committed to the Haiku repository, you can send a request for write access to <a href="https://www.freelists.org/list/haiku-development">the [haiku-development] mailing list</a>. In order to facilitate the task of reviewing your contributions and making a decision on your request, please include in the message a list of your patches (title and link to the Trac entry).</p>
