<p class="intro">The are many tasks you should look in to before publishing your new or latest application.</p>

- <a href="/community/getting-involved/translating">Translating your application</a> using catkeys files.
- <a href="/development/icon-guidelines">Create icons</a> for your application. At the <a href="https://hvif-store.art/">HVIF Store</a> you'll find hundreds of vector icons under free licenses that you can use directly or as a starting point for creating your own versions.
