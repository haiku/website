This year Haiku will be holding a virtual coding sprint (due to international travel restrictions), between 18th and the 31st of October. These dates were chosen because they matched up with the traditional dates for the in-person coding sprint and the BeGeistert conference.  

This also lines up with [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) - do note though that whilst working on Haiku, the operating system for Hacktoberfest won't work (the development work for this happens on our own hosted git repositories and on Gerrit, not on GitHub), helping out at [HaikuArchives](https://github.com/HaikuArchives), [HaikuPorts](https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports) or doing some work on our [website](https://github.com/haiku/website) and [web infrastructure](https://github.com/haiku/infrastructure) will as those are hosted on GitHub. 

## How does the coding sprint work?
In past years, coding sprints involved gathering developers in a room (a meeting room, usually) where they would work on Haiku. Obviously, with this virtual coding sprint everything will run online, presumably with an IRC channel or another online platform.  

Anyone can participate, and there is **no obligation on how much time you put in** even though the sprint runs for two weeks. It's a good opportunity for existing contributors to work on something Haiku-related, like fix bugs or embark on that large project that's been sitting on their to-do list for a while, or help resurrect an app (might be their own or an app from the BeOS days sitting around in [HaikuArchives waiting for some TLC](https://github.com/HaikuArchives)), help finalise patches waiting on [Gerrit](https://review.haiku-os.org), submit proposals, etc. etc. And since there'll be more people online during this sprint, you'll have plenty of help from your fellow developers on hand!

## What about new contributors?
This is also a good chance for new contributors to get started too! Just to ensure you're ready for the sprint, it's a good idea to first check out our [page on how you can get started on development](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/developing), with ideas on what you might like to work on. You might also want to:
* [Read the development FAQ](https://www.haiku-os.org/development/faq)
* [Read the Step by Step Guide for new contributors](https://www.haiku-os.org/development/getting-started)
* [Take a look at our coding guidelines](https://www.haiku-os.org/development/coding-guidelines)
* [Read the Programming with Haiku series of lessons](https://www.haiku-os.org/development/programming_with_haiku)
* [Join the development mailing list to stay up to date with the latest formal discussions ](https://www.freelists.org/list/haiku-development)
* [Have a look around and join the forums](https://discuss.haiku-os.org) - [there's a topic on the coding sprint](https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/haiku-coding-sprint-2021/11327) where you can post what you plan to work on.
* Join the Haiku IRC/Matrix channel at `#haiku` (IRC) or `#haiku:matrix.org` (Matrix) where you can talk with other developers and Haiku enthusiasts, ask questions, get feedback and advice. Here, a response to any query is never too far away! Feel free to say hello and don't be afraid to ask if you have any questions.  

We can guarantee you'll definitely find something to work on. Still have no idea what to do? Just ask on the forums or IRC/Matrix channel and we'll work together to find something you can work on.

If you're not much of a developer, it's a good time too to get stuck into some non-coding work for Haiku. If you're stuck on ideas, you might like to:
* [Help with translations](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/translating)
* [Write some documentation](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/documenting/)
* [Test out Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/testing/)
* [Do some design work](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/designing/)
* [Donate to us](https://www.haiku-inc.org/donate/) (more on that soon - watch this space!)

We hope this coding sprint is enjoyable and productive for all!
