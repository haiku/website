Since it is not so easy to organize in-person events currently, this year
coding sprint will be online.

In order to accomodate everyone, it will last for two weeks, and you are free
to join (or leave) at any time.

The event is open to everyone who wants to work on Haiku or any related software
project: write new applications, port existing applications, update already
ported applications, no matter if it's your own or someone else's. And of course
it's also possible to dig deeper into Haiku internals and fix some bugs there.

The event overlaps with Hacktoberfest, so you can also take part into that if
you want to.
