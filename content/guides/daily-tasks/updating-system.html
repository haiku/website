<p>Since the introduction of package management you can update your system in place using the pkgman command or the <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/applications/softwareupdater.html">SoftwareUpdater</a> application. The update process is straightforward, requires an internet connection, and requires a single reboot. pkgman/SoftwareUpdater will handle obtaining the latest updates and applying them to your system.</p>

<h2>Bleeding edge</h2>

Besides normal updates of your installed software and stable Haiku release, you can switch Haiku to Nightly builds (and back to stable release).

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Bleeding edge updates may occasionally fail if major ABI updates have taken place since the last update was performed.  While problems are rare, having backups is recommended before updating.</div>

<h1>Switching to Stable/Nightly builds</h1>
<p>To update your system to packages in the respective repository, there are a few simple steps to perform. (do <b>not</b> add single quotes around the urls, the $(getarch) is meant to be substituted by the shell)</p>

<h2>Nightly (unstable) builds</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Add the recommended stock nightly repository:<br/>
 <pre class="terminal">pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haiku/master/$(getarch)/current</pre></li>
 <li>Update to the latest packages:<br/><pre class="terminal">pkgman full-sync</pre></li>
 <li>Reboot once complete:<br/><pre class="terminal">shutdown -r</pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stable (r1beta3 in this example) builds</h2>
<div class="alert alert-info">HaikuPorts is currently 'master' for both Stable and Nightly builds.</div>
<ul>
 <li>Add the recommended stock stable (r1beta3) repositoris:<br/>
 <pre class="terminal">pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haiku/r1beta3/$(getarch)/current</pre></li>
 <li>Update to the latest packages:<br/><pre class="terminal">pkgman full-sync</pre></li>
 <li>Reboot once complete:<br/><pre class="terminal">shutdown -r</pre></li>
</ul>

<h1>Freeing some disk space</h1>
<p>When updating, old packages are kept in directories named "state_..." in <tt>/system/packages/administrative/</tt> to allow booting with previous states in case an update fails. After a while you might want to free up some disk space. You can safely remove the oldest state folders there, as well as the "transaction-..." ones. Do not touch the other directories though.</p>

<h1>Downgrading to a previous revision</h1>
<p>It's possible that an update to the latest Haiku revision (hrev) introduced a regression you're not willing to live with. From the boot options menu you can load a former, working hrev (see the user guide's <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/bootloader.html#troubleshooting">Boot Loader - Troubleshooting</a>). Find the last working state and boot into it.</p>
<p>To permanently downgrade to this revision, you have to point the 'Haiku' repository to that hrev. You find the current revision under "About Haiku" from the Deskbar. As example, for hrev56231:</p>
<pre class="terminal">pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haiku/master/$(getarch)/r1~beta3_hrev56231</pre>
<p>With "<tt>pkgman full-sync</tt>" you can now downgrade to that hrev56231.</p>
<p>Note, that you're now 'stuck' with that revision. You should report the regression and help to fix it, if you can. Once fixed - watch the <a href="http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/log/">commit logs</a> -  you can change back to the "current" repo.</p>
