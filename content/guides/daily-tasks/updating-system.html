<p>With the introduction of package management you can now upgrade your system in place using the pkgman command.  The update process is straightforward, requires an internet connection, and requires a single reboot. pkgman will handle obtaining the latest updates and applying them to your system.</p>

<h2>Bleeding edge</h2>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Bleeding edge updates may occasionally fail if major ABI updates have taken place since the last update was performed.  While problems are rare, having backups is recommended before updating.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">As of December 2017, automatic updates are <b>enabled by default</b> in nightly builds of Haiku, so these steps should be unneccessary and you can just run "SoftwareUpdater" to update your system. (If you are on a version older than that, you may need to still follow the steps here.)</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">Nightly images before hrev52316 ship with various package repository configurations as our infrastructure matured. If you are not getting updates, please try running <pre class="terminal">pkgman drop Haiku; pkgman drop HaikuPorts;</pre> before adding the repos below.</div>

<h1>Update process</h1>
<p>To update your system to packages in the repositories, there are a few simple steps to perform. (do <b>not</b> add single quotes around the urls, the $(getarch) is meant to be substituted by the shell)</p>

<h2>Stable (r1beta1 in this example) builds</h2>
<div class="alert alert-info">HaikuPorts is currently 'master' for both Stable and Nightly builds.</div>
<ul>
 <li>Add the recommended stock stable (r1beta1) repositories:<br/><pre class="terminal">pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haiku/r1beta1/$(getarch)/current
pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haikuports/master/$(getarch)/current</pre></li>
 <li>Update to the latest packages:<br/><pre class="terminal">pkgman update</pre></li>
 <li>Reboot once complete:<br/><pre class="terminal">shutdown -r</pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>Nightly (unstable) builds</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Add the recommended stock nightly repositories:<br/><pre class="terminal">pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haiku/master/$(getarch)/current
pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haikuports/master/$(getarch)/current</pre></li>
 <li>Update to the latest packages:<br/><pre class="terminal">pkgman update</pre></li>
 <li>Reboot once complete:<br/><pre class="terminal">shutdown -r</pre></li>
</ul>

<h1>Freeing some disk space</h1>
<p>When updating, old packages are kept in directories named "state_..." in <tt>/system/packages/administrative/</tt> to allow booting with previous states in case update fails. After a while you might want to free up some disk space. You can safely remove the oldest state folders there, as well as the "transaction-..." ones. Do not touch the other directories though.</p>

<h1>Downgrading to a previous revision</h1>
<p>It's possible that an update to the latest Haiku revision (hrev) introduced a regression you're not willing to live with. From the boot options menu you can load a former, working hrev (see the user guide's <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/bootloader.html#troubleshooting">Boot Loader - Troubleshooting</a>). Find the last working state and boot into it.</p>
<p>To permanently downgrade to this revision, you have to point the 'Haiku' and 'HaikuPorts' repositories to that hrev. You find the current revision under "About Haiku" from the Deskbar. As example, for hrev50380:</p>
<pre class="terminal">pkgman add https://packages.haiku-os.org/haiku/master/$(getarch)/r1~alpha4_pm_hrev50380
pkgman add https://packages.haiku-os.org/haikuports/master/repo/$(getarch)/by_hrev/hrev50380</pre>
<p>With "<tt>pkgman full-sync</tt>" you can now downgrade to that hrev50380.</p>
<p>Note, that you're now 'stuck' with that revision. You should report the regression and help to fix it, if you can. Once fixed - watch the <a href="http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/log/">commit logs</a> -  you can change back to the "current" repo.</p>
