<p>This guide describes how to install Haiku from Linux on a spare hard disk partition directly without using a CD-ROM or USB memory key. It is assumed that you are already running Linux and have prepared an empty partition for Haiku.</p>

<h2>Download Haiku</h2>

<p>You need to <a href="/get-haiku">download</a> an Anyboot image from the Haiku website.</p>

<h2>Convert Anyboot to a raw image</h2>

<p>Anyboot images are a combination of ISO and raw images. They can be written to DVDs, CD-ROMs, USB memory keys and hard disks. If you need to write the image to a partition, then you must first convert the Anyboot image to a raw image. You can do so using:</p>

<pre class="terminal">dd if=haiku-anyboot.image of=haiku.raw bs=1M skip=$(expr $(od -j 454 -N4 -i -A n haiku-anyboot.image) / 2048)
dd if=/dev/zero of=haiku.raw bs=1 seek=506 count=4 conv=notrunc</pre>

<h2>Write the raw image to a disk partition</h2>

<p>For example, to write the raw disk image to the second partition of your “sda″ device:</p>

<pre class="terminal">dd if=haiku.raw of=/dev/sda2 bs=1M conv=notrunc</pre>

<p>Please modify as needed.</p>

<h2>Make the partition bootable</h2>

<p>After the image is written to the partition, its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_boot_record">VBR</a> needs to be modified to make it bootable. You can either use the <a href="/guides/booting#makebootable-usage"><code>makebootable</code></a> program from Haiku, or <code>makebootabletiny</code> with Linux.</p>

<p>Assuming that you downloaded <code>makebootabletiny</code>, you need to compile and run it:</p>

<pre class="terminal">gcc makebootabletiny.c -o makebootabletiny
./makebootabletiny /dev/sda2</pre>

<h2>Add the partition to your boot manager</h2>

<p>This really depends on which boot manager you are using. For information on how to chain load Haiku from the GRUB 2 and GRUB Legacy boot managers, please see the <a href="/guides/booting#grub-2-version-1-96-and-higher">Configuring GRUB</a> guide.</p>

<h2>Set the partition type</h2>

<p>Optionally, you should set the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type">partition type</a> using <code>fdisk</code>. The partition type for Haiku's BFS file system should be set to "eb".</p>
