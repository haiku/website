Under <strong>Path or physical device name</strong>, click browse; then in the window so opened; <strong> change file type to ALL FILES from .img </strong> and select the Haiku .image file which you downloaded and moved to the <em>haiku</em> folder under Bochs.

Move down to where it says <em>Type of disk image</em> and make sure it says <strong>flat</strong>.

<h5 id="part_runningr">Step 4. Running Bochs.</h5>
Once you are back at the start menu, click <span class="button">Save</span> and save your setting to where your .image file is. This will create a bochsrc.bxrc file that you can click on to start Haiku.

<h3 id="part_additional">Additional Steps.</h3>
<h5>Creating a Link (Shortcut)</h5>
If You want you can enter that folder and create a link for the bochsrc.bxrc file to your desktop so you don't have to go looking for it. Make sure you change the link's name to some you will remember.

Now all you have to do double click on the link you created and you should be running Haiku!

<h5>Editing the .bxrc file</h5>
If something isn't just working right or you want to try a pre-made config file then you can download one for Haiku R1A4 <a href="/files/haiku.bxrc_.zip">here</a>.

Right click it and go edit or just open it with your favourite text editor.

You might have to change where the file looks for the raw and anyboot images' locations in the file if you are using Haiku after R1A4 however.<br>
