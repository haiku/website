<p>HaikuPorter is a python tool that takes a so-called recipe that describes the dependencies of a software and how to download, build and package it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/wiki/">HaikuPorts Wiki</a> has all the info to get started writing recipes. But it gets into too much detail if all you want is use HaikuPorter to build stuff with existing working recipes.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick step-by-step guide how to do that.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="1-getting-haikuporter-and-the-recipes">1. Getting HaikuPorter and the Recipes</h2>

<p>Get the HaikuPorter tool and the haikuports tree with all the recipes:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/haikuports/haikuporter.git --depth=50
git clone https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports.git --depth=50
</code></pre>

<p>That'll create two directories: "haikuporter" with the python tool and "haikuports" with all the recipes categorized in sub-folders. <code>--depth=50</code> limits the cloning to the last 50 commits to save download time and disk space.</p>



<h2 id="2-setting-up-haikuporter">2. Setting up HaikuPorter</h2>

<p>Put HaikuPorter into the system's “Path”, so it can be invoked like any other command:</p>

<pre><code>cd haikuporter
ln -s haikuporter ~/config/non-packaged/bin/
</code></pre>

<p>Copy and edit the haikuports configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>cp haikuports-sample.conf ~/config/settings/haikuports.conf
lpe ~/config/settings/haikuports.conf
</code></pre>

<p>In the haikuports.conf file you have to edit/un-comment the lines:</p>

<ul>
<li>TREE_PATH - where you cloned the haikuports tree, e.g. "/boot/home/haikuports"</li>
<li>PACKAGER - your name and email address, e.g. "<code>Humdinger &lt;humdinger@mymail.com&gt;</code>"</li>
<li>TARGET_ARCHITECTURE="x86_gcc2"</li>
<li>SECONDARY_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE="x86"</li>
</ul>

<p>This is for running the official 32bit Haiku (gcc2hybrid), where the older gcc2 compiler is the default to maintain BeOS compatibility and "x86" is a modern compiler (currently gcc5.4) for applications that won't build with the ancient gcc2.</p>



<h2 id="3-using-haikuporter">3. Using HaikuPorter</h2>

<p>Now you can start using HaikuPorter. You get all its options with "<code>haikuporter --help</code>".</p>

<p>In the haikuports tree, you search the recipe of the software you’d like to build. You can also use, e.g. "<code>haikuporter -o artpaint</code>" to have haikuporter look for a specific recipe, here for “ArtPaint”.</p>

<p>To build ArtPaint, you type:</p>

<pre><code>haikuporter -S -j4 --get-dependencies --no-source-packages artpaint
</code></pre>

<p>
<code>-S</code> : enforce "strict policy" to create standard compliant HPKGs.<br />
<code>-j4</code> : use 4 cores when building to save time.<br />
<code>--get-dependencies</code> : automatically download all packages needed for building that aren’t already installed.<br />
<code>--no-source-packages</code> : don’t create a package with the source code.<br />
<code>artpaint</code> : build the latest recipe for "ArtPaint".
</p>
<p>You find successfully built packages in the folder "<code>haikuports/packages</code>".</p>



<h2 id="4-tips-tricks">4. Keeping uptodate</h2>

<p>The haikuports tree receives almost daily changes with new, updated and fixed recipes. To stay abreast with those changes, you should regularly update. This is very easy with "<code>haikuporter --get</code>".</p>

<p>Likewise, haikuporter itself gets updated from time to time. At the latest if  recipes start to fail building, you should update. This, too, is quite easy; you enter the directory "haikuporter" that you have cloned in the 1st step and use <code>git</code> to pull in all changes:</p>
<pre><code>cd haikuporter
git pull</code></pre>


<h2 id="5-tips-tricks">5. Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To save yourself much typing, you can add this line to the file ~/config/settings/profile (a text file that you have to create if it doesn’t exist already):</p>

<pre><code>alias hp='haikuporter -S -j4 --get-dependencies --no-source-packages'
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can build with a simple "<code>hp artpaint</code>" and have those standard parameters added automatically.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Some software can’t be built with gcc2 and needs the modern compiler. You can see that in the recipes that declare:</p>

<pre><code>ARCHITECTURES="!x86_gcc2 x86 x86_64"
SECONDARY_ARCHITECTURES="x86"
</code></pre>

<p>The "!" says the package can't be built for that architecture. A "?" shows that it hasn't been tested for it.</p>

<p>In such a case, haikuporter will complain that "it is broken on the target architecture". You instruct haikuporter to build with the secondary architecture by appending a "<code>_x86</code>" to the recipe name, e.g. "<code> bepdf_x86</code>".</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Sometimes you find recipes for different versions of a software. HaikuPorter builds the latest by default. If you'd like a specific version, you can append the version number found in the recipe's filename, e.g. "<code>bepdf_x86-2.0.0</code>" to build v2.0.0 of BePDF for the secondary architecture (gcc5.4 currently).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If something goes wrong and you want a fresh start, open the folder of the recipe you try to build and delete all folders starting with "<code>work-</code>". Also delete the "<code>download</code>" folder if you suspect a corrupted source archive.<br />
Do a "<code>haikuporter artpaint -c</code>" for ArtPaint as example.
In some weird cases you may have to also delete the folders "<code>haikuports/packages</code>" and "<code>haikuports/repositories</code>", which will be time-consumingly recreated with the next build.</p>
</li>
</ul>
