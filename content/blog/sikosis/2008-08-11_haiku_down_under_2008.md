In May this year, I wrote to the Haiku Mailing List, proposing that the Australian Haiku Users and Developers hook up with an existing Open Source event to generate some Haiku interest in our Country. It was decided that the cost of heading to a central event, would be too costly and as we are spread out all over Australia, I then started thinking about plans of doing something online - a Virtual Conference, so to speak.

As Haiku's Anniversary is coming up on the 18th August -- I figured, we'd try and have an annual event centred around this date. Due to the short notice, I thought it would be best to keep it as simple as possible, and as this is the first event, it can then be used to generate more interest and discussions around Haiku.

So, if you have any ideas or suggestions of what you would like to see, please advise ASAP. Also, if you would like to show off your latest code or have something to say, please let me know also and we'll work that into the schedule.

The current schedule is:-

* Welcome to HDU + Brief History of Haiku
* How to get Haiku ?
* Beginners Guide to Haiku Coding
* Session Break
* A Guide to Windows, Views and BMessages (REPLACED)
* Suited n Booted aka Easy USB Booted

For the giveaways, I'm planning on raffling off some prizes such as licenses for well known Haiku apps such as WonderBrush, BePodder, etc.

So, I hope you can make it, if not, the video feed with demos and presentations will be online for all to see.
