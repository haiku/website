On the 8th September, I attended a local Unix user group called <a href="http://www.humbug.org.au/" target="_new">HUMBUG</a>, at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

This was their Annual General Meeting, which was very much an informal gathering of 34 unix users and with the <a href="http://gallery.sikosis.com/main.php?g2_itemId=12113" target="_new">Haiku presence</a> we had, we definitely made an impression; certainly more people know about Haiku than yesterday, and that's gotta be a good thing.

Earlier that day when I was driving to the University, I got stuck behind this white hatchback, which had the license plate letters KDL. I thought, this was some sort of omen, however, I can announce there were no hiccups during the demos I gave.

We had a number of Linux and OpenBSD users come over to <a href="http://gallery.sikosis.com/main.php?g2_itemId=12157" target="_new">"Haiku Command Central"</a> to see what all the hardware and the fuss was about (except the Yellow Dog guy playing Second Life at the back of the room). Thanks to the fine artwork of Stippi, reproduced with flare by Koki, <a href="http://myhaiku.org/haiku-related-artwork/#flyers" target="_new">the flyers</a> went down a treat and we gave out about 10 to interested users; One guy had even downloaded the <a href="http://factory.haiku-os.org" target="_new">Haiku VMware image</a> before I'd spoken to him. 

All and all, it was a good little informal gathering of computer geeks, where we spread the good word of Haiku, unfortunately the Internet connection at the event was restricted, so we had to use Mojo's wifi VPN (thankfully he works at the Uni) in order to access IRC and <a href="http://ustream.tv/channel/haikupodcast-live-show" target="_new">ustream's webcast</a> service.

We had a number of users in the chat and I'd like to thank them all for joining in, even though it might not have been timezone-friendly for you. We hope to do more from HUMBUG and other events in the future.

Until then, Keep on Haiku-ing.
