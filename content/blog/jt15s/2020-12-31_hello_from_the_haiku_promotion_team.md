Hi there, I'm jt15s, a new Haiku community member! I've been following the project for a few years now since I stumbled upon an article about Haiku. 

If you read the title (which I'm assuming you did), you’re probably going, "wait, we have a promotion team now?" Well, yes, now we do. As an informal “team” of two (currently), we are super excited to share our plans to help promote Haiku and make more people aware of it.

## Who's in it?
Me, as well as scott_puopolo18 as of now. We are also working with Haikunauts and BeSly, two Haiku-related resources. However, anyone who wishes to help is more than welcome to! Reach out to me (jt15s) [on the forums](https://discuss.haiku-os.org) if you are interested. If you don't have a forum account yet, create one - a forum account is free! We are also looking for the following informal roles:
* Video Editor - it would be good to have someone produce video content for Haiku. Videos wouldn’t need to be too complex: just something that looks simple yet professional and something less than 10 minutes long.
* Presenter - we need someone who is a confident speaker and who can speak in front of a camera (preferably with a good camera setup too) to be the face (or voice) of any Haiku videos we make, to give them a more “human touch”.
* Graphic Designer - it would be nice if we had someone who was solely responsible for producing graphics for Haiku promotion. Graphics should be uploaded to both the website and Haiku Artwork repository using Github, but I’m more than happy to help teach people how to do that.
* Live Stream Technician - we are considering doing live streams, but we will need someone with technical knowledge of live-streaming who can help facilitate this.
* Events Coordinator - it would be good to have someone search for events which Haiku could take part in (i.e. FOSS conferences) and help organise Haiku’s participation in these events.

## Our promotional strategy
As the promotion team, we want to make sure people know about Haiku. One of the biggest problems facing the project is that we are more obscure than other FOSS projects. This means it's harder to get new contributors, whether this is developers, documentation writers or just volunteers in general. Hence we aim to attract more attention towards Haiku, and in turn, new users and volunteers. 

**I would like to take this opportunity to urge you to help the project: you don't need to be a programmer to help out. [You can find ways to get involved here.](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/)**

How will we do this, you might ask? Well, there are a couple of aspects of our strategy. 

### The media and reviewers
A database of all the reviews/mentions of Haiku is being compiled for easy reference and so we can contact a variety of media sources when we have a new release. Additionally, we are looking for more technology-related channels who may have not mentioned or reviewed Haiku before and see if they are interested in having a closer look at the OS. 

In terms of the media in general, we are planning to prepare press releases for the media - a press release is simply a formal, properly formatted version of an announcement. By releasing press releases it makes it easier for other media organisations to find major Haiku announcements and run a story about Haiku. 

In terms of reviewers, as mentioned before we are planning to contact reviewers and media organisations once Beta 3 is released. We have also prepared a reviewer information sheet with tips for reviewers, which is in the draft stage. 

### Businesses
Businesses can benefit from Haiku as an operating system, and personally, I see Haiku as a lightweight alternative to the proprietary desktop operating systems businesses currently use. 

An information sheet for businesses has been drafted, which gives businesses a rundown of Haiku and its advantages and disadvantages as a business-oriented operating system. However, to attract more businesses we must improve Haiku further, and hence we will delay marketing efforts for businesses until Haiku reaches a stable and mature stage. 

### Partnerships with other Haiku-related sources
If you haven't heard of them already, BeSly and Haikunauts are the two major third party Haiku sources. BeSly is a wiki with tips and tricks on using Haiku, whilst Haikunauts is a blog aimed at promoting Haiku as an OS. As mentioned above, we will work in partnership with these two sources and see what we can do together to help spread the word about Haiku.

Additionally, we are also eager to work with any smaller blogs, websites or channels. If you run a blog, website, channel, or any other source, please contact me via the forums and let me know!

### General
I am thinking of running an advertisement in _Read the Doc_s, a documentation website that serves a wide array of open-source projects. _Read the Docs_ allocates a portion of their advertising inventory to FOSS projects such as ourselves, hence this is a good opportunity to promote Haiku. What will go on the advertisement has not been decided as of now.

scott_puopolo18 is working on a set of interview questions for our developers. By interviewing the developers we can give the public a glimpse into the world of Haiku development, as well as shining a light on the challenges and opportunities in an open-source project. The predetermined set of questions means that we don't have to write new questions for each developer: to save time, we can simply send them off and the developer can write their response.

We are also planning to distribute more content via our often under-utilised social media platforms, as well as update them with current information (i.e. adding profile page art, applying for verification, updating or adding links etc.). Short-form posts on social media are what immediately comes to mind, although we are considering live-streams or videos if there is someone willing to help out.

Haikunauts also has several other ideas for promotional events, but we will share these with you later as we are still working out the details of these events.

### Closing Words
We are super excited to see how we can promote Haiku and help the project gain new members and volunteers. **Remember, if you’d like to join, don’t hesitate in sending me a private message on the forums!**

I’d also like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Happy New Year - here’s to a more fruitful, happy and lucky new year!
