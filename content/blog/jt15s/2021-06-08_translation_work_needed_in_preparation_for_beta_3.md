As we get closer to the release of Beta 3, it is important we ensure our translations are updated.

## Current State of Translation Work
- As of now, no new language has currently reached over 60% since Beta 2 was released last year.
- Croatian translations are at 58%. **If no progress is made, this translation risks being removed from Beta 3!**
- Korean, Hindi, Bulgarian, Czech and Norwegian were already under 60% in beta2 and are still under 60%, somewhere between 45% and 60% complete. **It would be really appreciated if these translations were made more complete so they can be included with the Beta 3 release.**
- Languages that are already available on Pootle, but need a lot more work: 
	- Punjabi
	- Slovenian 
	- Arabic (unfortunately this translation can’t be displayed due to lack of right-to-left text support in Haiku) 
	- Serbian (both Latin and Cyrillic versions)
	- Macedonian
	- Maori 
	- Low German
	- Persian
	- Na’vi

## Pootle
{{< alert-info "Translation Cut-off for Haiku's User Interface" "The cut-off for interface translations on Pootle remains at 60%.">}}

- **All translators are encouraged to make an extra release-effort to bring their language as close as they can to 100%.** 
- **All language managers are urged to check and approve waiting submissions.**

## Haiku User Guide Translations
{{< alert-info "Translation Cut-off for the Haiku User Guide" "The cut-off for User Guide translations on Pootle is higher at 80%.">}}
Since Beta 2, there have been a few changes here and there to the User Guide, so **languages that were about 100% translated back then will need a few updates to ensure they are fully translated for Beta 3.**
