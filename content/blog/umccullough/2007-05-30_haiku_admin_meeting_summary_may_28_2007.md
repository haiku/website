<p><b>Haiku Admin Meeting 2007-05-28:</b>
<ul>
<li>Discussion about new "Admin organizer" internal-use website for managing tasks, admin votes, etc.</li>
<li>Some discussion took place about possibly organizing a physical "admin gathering" somewhere.</li>
<li>Michael Lotz has volunteered, and is currently a primary candidate for "Project management" type tasks.</li>
<li>Mention of the need to assign/complete the Haiku, Inc. 2006 financial publication.</li>
<li>Discussed Haiku Compatible Badges:</li>
It appears many are currently in favor of Stephan's designs.
Mention of possible "Haiku powered" or "Haiku inside" on a badge.
Should open-vote be used similar to the icon sets? Further discussion about decision will be moved to Admin mailing list.
Currently collecting all the "entries" from the <a href="/community/ml#haiku">General Mailing List</a>.
<li>Some WalterCon scheduling options discussed:</li>
Discussed what types of content should be provided for attendees.
Reminder of <a href="http://www.my3q.com/view/viewSummary.phtml?questid=168689">survey results</a>. <em>(Ed note: Survey should now be closed as of June 1, 2007)</em>
Note that most attendees could fall into "User" and "Application Developer" categories.
Possibly an audio driver API presentation?
<li>Discussion about Haiku Compatibility List:</li>
Should it remain as an external site - or try to move it to the official site?
If hosted internally, should it still be primarily a community-driven effort? This would probably ensure it remains up-to-date.
Karl should be contacted to discuss options.
<li>Discussed possibility of opening a "bounties" section on the official site:</li>
Bounties should be reasonable.
Could both Haiku-sponsored bounties and community-initiated bounties be supported? If yes, they should be clearly separated to avoid confusion about sponsorship.
</ul>
<b>That wraps it up for the May 28, 2007 meeting.</b>
