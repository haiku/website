<p><b>Haiku Admin Meeting 2007-06-18:</b>
<ul>
<li>Discussion about some "missing" articles on the new website - specifically old newsletters. Also desired is a way to make them easier to locate.</li>
<li>Mention of the continual "browser for Haiku" topic that pops up in the mailing list and elsewhere. An official decision should be discussed and published. It may be still too early to fully decide on a direction.</li>
<li>More discussion took place about a potential physical "admin gathering" in the near future.</li>
</ul>

<b>End of June 18, 2007 and June 26, 2007 meetings.</b>
