<p>Hello everyone,<br /><br />
As you already know I am working on <strong>HarfBuzz Support on Haiku</strong> this summer. You can find my introduction post here. In this post I will be you a brief details of my last 2 weeks with Haiku.<br /><br />
<h3>Getting to know people:</h3><br /><br />
Considering the fact I have been in Haiku Community earlier I already knew a lot of members. I just wanted to mention a few who helped in these past 2 weeks.<br /><br />
<strong>Stippi(Stephan):</strong> He is one of the coolest guy I have met, apart from questions related to the project. I messaged him with some questions related to my personal computer and guess what? He was happy to help.<br /><br />
<strong>PulkoMandy:</strong> It wasn't the first time I was communicating with Pulkomandy. I learned more about PulkoMandy in these 2 weeks and trust me, his hands are dirty, dirty with codes. He one of the guy with knowledge of everything related to Haiku.<br /><br /><strong>Humdinger:</strong> He is the best when it comes to merging my PR xD<br /><br />
<strong>Waddlesplash:</strong> Got any issue related to website? Ping him and he will fix it in a gist.<br /><br />
<h3>Project update:</h3><br /><br />
I devoted my last two weeks on learning more about Harfbuzz and testing Hindi Language on Haiku.<br />I promised to share screenshots of Hindi and other languages on various operating systems in my proposal.<br />This image is self-explainatory and tell you what's wrong with rendering on Haiku right now.<br /><br />

I have also prepared a video which gives details on how this project will help Haiku.<br /><br />

<strong>Next Goal:</strong> With the help my mentors I will be working on a small application that can render text using Harfbuzz.<br /><br />Overall, my interest is directly proportional to the learning done in the project. Trust me, right now it is at a steap hike. Thank you for choosing me for this project.</p>
