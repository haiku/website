<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This is my first post during the coding period of GSoC 2017. I have been working on a demo application which renders text using the harfbuzz library.The work on application started before the coding period. You can find the application <a href="https://github.com/digib0y/DemoHarfbuzzApp">here</a>.</p>
<p>The work on application started before the coding period, but now the application is successfully running(Thanks to stippi!).</p>
<p>I pointed out few issues in one of my <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/digib0y/2017-05-19_gsoc_2017_harfbuzz_week_1_2_of_community_bond/">previous blog </a>post. I have used the same words in Hindi for rendering in application. You will see that it is being rendered properly.</p>
<p>I would take the time out and say the rendering is more accurate and better when compared to rendering on Ubuntu 16.04.</p>
<p>I request if anyone here can read in languages in the screenshot below, let me know the feedback on their rendering.</p><br /><br />
