<p>What happens when you combine 337 students, 20+ mentors, and an endless volley of tasks? During the time from November 2016 to January 2017, 368 Haiku tasks were successfully completed. The seventh year of <a href="http://codein.withgoogle.com">Google’s Code-In</a>, and the seventh for Haiku as a mentoring organization was a grand success.</p>

<p>Students from all around the world aged 13-17 worked with the project mentors on improving Haiku during the 7 weeks of the contest. They coded applications, designed artwork, tested software, and wrote recipes, and more than anything else, had fun.</p>

<p>Out of the 10 students who completed the maximum number of tasks, finalists and grand prize winners were picked collectively by the diligent team of Haiku’s 20+ mentors.</p>

<p>Haiku had an impressive growth in the number of students:</p>
