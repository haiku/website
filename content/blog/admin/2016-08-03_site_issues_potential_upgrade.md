The Haiku site has run into some difficulties as of late.  Drupal 6.x is now <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol" title="end of life">end of life</a> which means modules are no longer being maintained.  This has greatly impacted the stability of the site as the final urgent Drupal 6.x security updates have been applied.

The web team is working through plans to improve the Haiku website and community. Please be patient while we transition to a better long-term solution.
