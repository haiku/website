What happens when you combine 337 students, 20+ mentors, and an endless volley of tasks? During the time from November 2016 to January 2017, 368 Haiku tasks were successfully completed. The seventh year of Google’s Code-In, and the seventh for Haiku as a mentoring organization was a grand success.

Students from all around the world aged 13-17 worked with the project mentors on improving Haiku during the 7 weeks of the contest. They coded applications, designed artwork, tested software, and wrote recipes, and more than anything else, had fun.

Out of the 10 students who completed the maximum number of tasks, finalists and grand prize winners were picked collectively by the diligent team of Haiku’s 20+ mentors.

We are thankful for your precious contributions and will be delighted see you continue to [contribute](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/) even after the program.This year Jessica Hamilton will make the trip to meet the winners as both the students picked her.

Haiku had an impressive growth in the number of students [](/files/blog/deepanshu/graph_gci2016)

To list some of the students’ achievements:

•A map application (github.com/raefaldhia/maps), and a music manager for Haiku were coded.
•Over 50 recipes were written for HaikuPorts.
•Around 15+ recipes were de-linted.
•A dozen QA test plans were documented.
•Icons for Becasso, Hexvexed, Freeciv, Rocks 'n' Diamonds, and 2048 were created, as well as more icons to be used in the Weather application.
•WhereMyMouse and CaptialBe were updated to use the Layout Management.
•Addition of missing email provider information.
•Addition of Pthreads barriers implementation to Haiku.
•Articles converted to markdown for the new Haiku website.
•Video [tutorials](http://haiku-files.org/files/media/) were prepared.
•Presenting Haiku at their schools or other local groups.
•Supplying icons, screenshots, and categories for packages in HaikuDepot.
•and much more!

I hope that despite probably being the best of their age in their field, the winning students will stay humble, and hunger for new knowledge.

So congratulations and thanks to all our hardworking students and their mentors, and especially Scott McCreary who once again shouldered the responsibility of administrating Haiku’s GCI participation.
