i'm going to miss those of you at Haiku who are moving on. i'm in a dark time of my life, maybe the end, and i revisit the old good times now and then and BeOS is one of the bright, shining gems, despite the bittersweet facts of how it all went down.

i'm still breathing at the moment. i still run BeOS (GoBe Productive owns all my writing ;-) and i could use tips on getting out of the DNS nightmare i am having with Verizon and BeOS Pro R5.0.3 ... :-(

i've not had any contact with anyone from beunited.org despite attempts over the last two years (not great attempts, but some). If anyone from beunited.org wants to regroup, let me know.

BeWine is still a nowhere project for the same reasons as before, sorry.

Once everything changes over at Haiku, please please please do not make Haiku into a Linux, MacOSX or Windows. PLEASE. Remember the ideals and the models. Classic MacOS simplicity of design, modern function and PalmOS-like live states of data and functions and no "OK CANCEL APPLY" or all that shtupe.

Most of all, keep the current design motif. It is beautiful and is original.

and i am STILL holding on to the ridiculous hope that Access will eventually open source some parts of BeOS. i sent them a request just a few days ago (nicely). Who knows. i mean, i still own a PalmOS device which i am still in love with (Zodiac2) and when i booted BeOS just yesterday and felt its warm touch again... it made me smile. How geeky is that?

Best to you all and keep in touch if you like :-)
