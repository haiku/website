As you may have read recently, I've had to withdraw from the code drive this summer.  Luckily, another student has stepped up to take over my spot.  I hope his project is a success and that I'll be able to jump back in later in the summer.

I've had to reorganize my priorities because I was accepted into an REU program in which I'll do graduate style research for the summer.  I'm looking to attend graduate school so this was an opportunity I could not pass up.  Thankfully Matt Madia was quite understanding and was even able to locate another student to take over from me.

I will be doing research at the University of Wisconsin until the end of July.  The project I'm working on is a drive to collect, create, and evaluate the effectiveness of visualizations of algorithms.  The resulting collection will be used across many universities in their CS programs.

With that said, I'm pretty much without spare time for the next weeks.  I've got an eye on the Haiku project though, and I'll be back and contributing when I'm able.  Thanks for the opportunity and good luck to everyone this summer!
