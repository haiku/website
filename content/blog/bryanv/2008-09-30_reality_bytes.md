After nearly three years, I'm finally winding down all the home-improvement projects that have been bogging me down and consuming the time I haven't devoted to my family, friends, job, and immediate community. I also have Haiku running on my iMac, virtualized in VirtualBox. I am working on getting the data from my old UW SCSI development disc to an image on this machine as I type this.

That's the good news.

Now for the bad (well, for you, not me).

I feel like I should apologize for not having invested more time in the Java effort. This is not how I'd envisioned things would go, this is not how I'd wanted them to. I've seriously neglected this project and for that, I'm sorry. Judging from the total lack of gnashing of teeth, I'm going to guess it's not that big of a deal to anyone else either. Just know, this isn't how I'd wanted it to go.

As many of you may know my wife, Kylene and I are expecting our first child in early December. I've got about six weeks before my life totally changes forever. I'm not worried, I'm not sad, and I'm not regretting a dang thing. The last three years have been a trip and I'm sure the ones to come will be just as interesting.

So while it's nice to try and ignore reality and wistfully believe you can accomplish everything you've ever set out to do if you just get that one next small thing finished, eventually reality bites you in butt, and you have to turn around and face it.

Which is why, some two weeks ago, I sent an email to Mark Reinhold of OpenJDK (and Sun) asking to transfer ownership of the OpenJDK Haiku port project to Andrew Bachmann. Still no response on that, but we're working toward it. Basically, I cannot commit to leading the charge here. I can't even really commit to ever being able to work on this again. I'd like to think I'll have at least some time to dedicate to this in the coming year, but for some reason I don't think I'll get much coding done at 1AM while I'm trying to get a screaming infant to quiet down. I'm also selling off (or giving away) all my old hardware from the glory days of R5.

If anyone would like my Adaptec 2460UW, the cable, and the 8GB drive attached to it that contains all the source for the java 1.4 port (and a few other java-based apps that I got working on BeOS) feel free to drop me a line. I would rather send it directly to someone who will make use of it than to send it to Haiku to redistribute. It'll reduce costs, and I'll know with whom to follow up. So speak up, if you want it.

I also have an assortment of graphics cards, network adapters, an UW SCSI2 RAID controller... I plan to catalog all these parts this weekend. If anyone is interested in these for driver-development, I'll donate the hardware for that kind of cause.
