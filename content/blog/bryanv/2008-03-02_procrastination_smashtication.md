After procrastinating for far too long on getting a project proposal in to the OpenJDK Community Innovators' Challenge, I finally drafted and <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/challenge-discuss/2008-March/000096.html">submitted a proposal to port HotSpot to Haiku, x86</a> just a few hours before the deadline.

Should the project be selected, Andrew and I will likely have ample motivation to accomplish the stated goals of the proposal on time. I firmly believe the goals set forth are reasonable, seeing as Andrew is a machine, and this time around I know a whole lot more about what we're doing with the VM. I should actually be able to help at this level this time. Amazing, eh?

I wrote this thing in about an hour this afternoon, called for other participants on the haiku porting project mailing list (never heard anything back) and submitted the final proposal several hours later. My apologies to anyone who may have been sleeping at that time.

I don't know what our chances of acceptance are. I have no idea. I'd like to think they're good, but I'm going to remain skeptical.

The way this challenge is structured, organizations (like Haiku itself) cannot sponsor proposals, only individuals (in teams of up to 10) can propose or sponsor proposals.
