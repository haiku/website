This is the twelveth progress report for TrackGit project. I did the following in last week:

## Implemented Log Viewer

I implemented a log viewer in TrackGit. It shows a window with the commits in  the repository so far. [Link](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit/commit/012a47617d78bd8a8eddfd8386e2b454cf03a2d3) to commit.

The following screenshot shows the log viewer:

I also added tests for the log command. [Link](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit/commit/581c731134ce0dd70dca46778fc2ed1f6e1ba11d) to commit.
