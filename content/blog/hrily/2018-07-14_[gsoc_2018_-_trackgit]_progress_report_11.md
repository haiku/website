This is the eleventh progress report for TrackGit project. I did the following in last week:

## Implemented Create Branch command

I implemented Create Branch command. This command creates a branch at head of the repository. There is also an option to switch to the newly created branch. [Link](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit/commit/d6a8b90f6f77e5e29ad56b2470d5977dd38ae71d) to commit.

The following screenshot shows Create Branch window:

## Implemented Switch Branch command

I implemented option to switch branch. The Switch Branch window gives user with a drop down list of branches in current repository. Then user selects the desired branch and the repo is switched to that branch. [Link](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit/commit/921517b2171c3f801c3df8b31c1e855d12959b93) to commit.
