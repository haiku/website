This is the second progress report for TrackGit project. I did the following in last week.


## TrackGit repo

I created the repository for TrackGit. You can follow it at [https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit). 

I also created [Wiki](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit/wiki) to maintain the Weekly Progress report.

## Icon for TrackGit

I added icon to project using a rdef file.

## LibGit2

TrackGit uses libgit2 as interface for git. I tried compiling TrackGit using libgit2 but getting some header errors. I'm getting help from mentors regarding this.

## BLayoutBuilder

TrackGit has few windows. So, I need to learn how to use BLayoutBuilder, which I started to learn recently.
