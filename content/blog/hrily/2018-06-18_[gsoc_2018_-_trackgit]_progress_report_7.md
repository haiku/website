This is the seventh progress report for TrackGit project. I did the following in last week.


## Merge Request on Haiku

At the start of the project, I had made a merge request on Haiku regarding Dynamic Add on menu. There were few comments on it which I forgot to check. I addressed those comments. [Link](https://review.haiku-os.org/#/c/164/) to the merge request.


## Implemented Add files command 

I implemented the Add files command. This option adds the selected files to the git repository. [Link](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit/commit/3d11dabf16511f04ff6cdaa25fe7b5e75fdb0cf5) to the commmit.


## Implemented Add All files

This option is shown when no files are selected. This option adds all the changed files to the git repository. It is equivalent of `git add --all`. It is handy sometimes. [Link](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit/commit/a50255ccd23382f6cc082dcfb1d4b986dbb42cb4) to commit.


## Addressed Stephens comments

Stephen posted some comments on my commits. I addressed them towards the end of the week. [Link](https://github.com/Hrily/TrackGit/commit/933a29f9bdef1c6f323d19c118517f83d8806e8c) to thread.
