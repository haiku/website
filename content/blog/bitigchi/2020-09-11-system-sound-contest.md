It wouldn't be wrong to say that, Haiku is a unique operating system. It takes its roots from BeOS, the OS everyone envied back in the day. Haiku continues to follow its footsteps, trying to deliver that same experience. What could be better than complementing this unique operating system with a set of unique system sounds?

As R1 steadily approaches, we are looking for contestants (amateur, professional, enthusiast) to produce system sound effects for Haiku. Specifically sounds for:

## Sound Events

**Errors:**

- Beep
- Error notification

**Notifications:**

- Important notification
- Information notification
- Progress notification

**Key/mouse events:**

- Key down
- Key repeat
- Key up
- Keymap switch
- Mouse down
- Mouse up

**Window events:**

- Window activated
- Window close
- Window minimised
- Window open
- Window restored
- Window zoomed

In addition to these above, a nice soothing **startup chime**. :)

## What to consider

- All sound events except the startup chime should be up to 1 second long. If the situation calls for, it can be longer, but it **should** not exceed 2 seconds. For startup chime, the limit is 5 seconds.
- They should be non-intrusive. Distorted tunes are not welcome.
- Expanding on "haiku" and related themes are encouraged.
- Entries need to be in WAV format (44,100 Hz, 16 bits ps).
- Entries should include a note that the work is licensed under [CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) or a similar license.
- Naming the sound files according to their theme is encouraged, but intended sound event should be noted appropriately.

## Deadline

Deadline for the contest is December 1st, 2020; we would like to ship these with Beta3 for users to experience them and give feedback.

Currently Haiku does not support sound themes, but the idea is to use a couple of entries as sound themes later on, with the contest winner being the default sound theme.

## How to participate

Send an e-mail to humdingerb (gmail) com and bitigchi (me) com with a link to your zipped up work. Entries and news regarding the contest will be published on [this Haiku Forums thread](). The thread will not be open for public posting, and will be used for publishing purposes only.

The winner will be announced on the above-mentioned thread and the Haiku general mailing list. Modifications will be accepted until November 27th, 2020.

Thanks for being a part of the Haiku universe!
