Hello World.

This is Anirudh. Here's my final overall report of my work during Google Summer of Code 2017.
My sincere thanks to **waddlesplash** and **Sean Healy**, for their excellent mentorship.
They immediately responded, and assisted me whenever I needed help. I'm grateful to
the Haiku team, community members and my fellow GSoC colleagues for their help, constructive criticism, reporting bugs and helping the project shape better.

## Achieved so far
As proposed, SuperPrefs now boasts:
* Control Panel Interface
* Categorization of Preflets
* Inclusive of both System Prefs and Custom User Prefs
* Localized Preflets’ Name Search
* Related Keywords Search
* Apps View [Needs improvement]

## What’s left to do
* Localization for Related Keywords and additional keywords
* Option to enable Apps View only if needed
* Option to set Custom Categories
* Making individual preferences better [Ironically the original goal]
* Contribute to Haiku in one way or other

## Things learnt
#### Technically
* How to code and how not to code
* Better Object Oriented Software Engineering approaches
* Exposure to how open-source organizations work
* Of course, Git, C++, Standard Template Library, Haiku API

#### Non Technically
* Consistency > Pace
* Late nights cause Burnout
* Multi tasking Academic work and GSoC
* Effective Communication through IRC, Mailing lists
* Documentation

If you’re a student and reading this for future GSoC programs, I’d highly recommend you to submit a proposal for Haiku. So, it’s been an amazing summer, thanks again Haiku and the Google Summer of Code team.
