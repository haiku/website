Hello World.

This is Anirudh. Here's my final overall report of my work during Google Summer of Code 2017.
My sincere thanks to **waddlesplash** and **Sean Healy**, for their excellent mentorship.
They immediately responded, and assisted me whenever I needed help. I'm grateful to
the Haiku team, community members and my fellow GSoC colleagues for their help, constructive criticism, reporting bugs and helping the project shape better.

## Achieved so far
<ul>
<li>Control Panel Interface</li>
<li>Categorization of Preflets</li>
<li>Inclusive of both System Prefs and Custom User Prefs</li>
<li>Localized Preflets’ Name Search</li>
<li>Related Keywords Search</li>
<li>Apps View [Needs improvement]</li>
</ul>

## What’s left to do
<ul>
<li>Localization for Related Keywords and additional keywords</li>
<li>Option to enable Apps View only if needed</li>
<li>Option to set Custom Categories</li>
<li>Making individual preferences better [Ironically the original goal]</li>
<li>Contribute to Haiku in one way or other</li>
</ul>

## Things learnt
#### Technically
<ul>
<li>How to code and how not to code</li>
<li>Better Object Oriented Software Engineering approaches</li>
<li>Exposure to how open-source organizations work</li>
<li>Of course, Git, C++, Standard Template Library, Haiku API</li>
</ul>

#### Non Technically
<ul>
<li>Consistency > Pace</li>
<li>Late nights cause Burnout</li>
<li>Multi tasking Academic work and GSoC</li>
<li>Effective Communication through IRC, Mailing lists</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

If you’re a student and reading this for future GSoC programs, I’d highly recommend you to submit a proposal for Haiku. So, it’s been an amazing summer, thanks again Haiku and the Google Summer of Code team.
