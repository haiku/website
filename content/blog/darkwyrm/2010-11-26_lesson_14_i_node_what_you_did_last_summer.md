A holiday treat! In this lesson we continue to work our way through the Storage Kit, learning about one of the lesser-known features of the Haiku API: node monitoring. For those new to Haiku, it notifies programs of changes to the filesystem, such as changes in a name, etc. If you're looking to turn a good Haiku app into a fine one, this is one way to do it.
