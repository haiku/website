It's hard for me to believe that I've been publishing these mostly-weekly lessons for almost a month and a half. It's been really fun. I hope that those of you reading them have been enjoying reading (and hopefully learning from) them as I have in writing them. This one covers two major topics: memory management and binary math, nothing terribly exciting, but really useful and necessary nonetheless. <a href="http://darkwyrm.beemulated.net/downloads/pdf/Learning%20to%20Program%20With%20Haiku%20Lesson%207.pdf">Learn to Program With Haiku, Lesson 7.</a>
