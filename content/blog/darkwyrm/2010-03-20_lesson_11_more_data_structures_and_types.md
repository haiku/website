This time around, we will be examining some important kinds of data structures and ways to create custom data types, a critical stepping stone in getting to understanding the Haiku API. This is the last C / C++ lesson -- the rest will be C++ only. A couple more lessons and we'll finally be ready to write GUI programs for Haiku! Enjoy! <a href="http://darkwyrm.beemulated.net/downloads/pdf/Learning%20to%20Program%20With%20Haiku%20Lesson%2011.pdf">Learning to Program with Haiku, Lesson 11</a>.
