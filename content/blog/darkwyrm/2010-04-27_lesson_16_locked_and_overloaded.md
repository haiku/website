It's strange how a week goes by so quickly now, but it's good motivation to keep writing! This lesson takes a break from hacking the Haiku API to learn a few C++ language concepts needed to continue progress as an aspiring developer. Function overloading and operator overloading are examined in detail. Enjoy! <a href="http://darkwyrm.beemulated.net/downloads/pdf/Learning%20to%20Program%20With%20Haiku%20Lesson%2016.pdf">Learning to Program With Haiku, Lesson 16.</a>
