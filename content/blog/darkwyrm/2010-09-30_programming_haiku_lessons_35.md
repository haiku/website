In an attempt to move on and get on to just the Haiku API, here are the final three lessons on C++. Lesson 3 introduces C++ file streams, formatting and printing using C++ streams, and lightly touches on exceptions. Lesson 4 takes a break from actual coding and spends time on a critical development tool: source control -- what it is, how it is used, and why it is used. Lesson 5 ties together all of the C++ concepts covered in this series with a project. I hope you enjoy them.
