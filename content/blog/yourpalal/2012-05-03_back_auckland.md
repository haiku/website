<p>With one big <a href="http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/tag/?id=hrev44092">push</a> the work I did on ALM (Auckland Layout Model) while I was at the University of Auckland is now in the main Haiku repo. In short, I&rsquo;ve brought the BALMLayout up to standard with the other layouts in Haiku, and added some new features as well.
<!--break-->
Like the other layouts, it now supports the BArchivable API and fully and properly implements BLayout. While I was away, I also worked on creating Java bindings for the Haiku API, as I mentioned in an earlier <a href="/blog/yourpalal/2012-03-01_haiku_java">post</a>. With this work landing in the repo, all that&rsquo;s left for ALM is some renaming and file shuffling before it can become an official part of the Haiku API!<br><br>All in all, I had a great time in Auckland, and I got to meet other people that have worked on Haiku IRL for the first time! This was a great opportunity and I&rsquo;m glad the pieces all came together. The UoA was very supportive and my supervisors were friendly and helpful. Once again I want to thank Matt Madia, Carol Smith at Google&rsquo;s Open Source Programs Office , the UoA, and my family for their help and support in this endeavour.<br><br>If you&rsquo;re interested in working with the UoA on something Haiku-related, I&rsquo;m sure <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~lutteroth/">Christof</a> would love to hear from you.</p>
