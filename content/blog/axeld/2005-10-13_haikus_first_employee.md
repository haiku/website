This blog is supposed to accompany my Haiku development efforts while being employed by the non-profit organisation behind Haiku , Haiku Inc.<br /><br />Thanks to the donations you made to Haiku Inc., I will work full time until the end of november - that means 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I'm not getting rich by doing this, but it should be enough to pay my bills. I don't even get more money if you would donate more - it would just make such an event more likely to happen again. Thanks for making this happening, anyway.<br /><br />I intend to regularly update this blog during the next few weeks to give you an overview over what I am currently working on, and how I progress doing it.
