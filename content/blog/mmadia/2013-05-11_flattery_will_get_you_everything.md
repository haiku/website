Another development in Haiku's donation infrastructure has been implemented! This time it's <a href="http://flattr.com/">Flattr - Social microdonations</a>. Flattr is a way for you to set a monthly donation budget, which then automatically gets divided into equal pieces and donated to people you choose to "Flattr". You can read more about <a href="http://flattr.com/howflattrworks">How Flattr Works</a>. 

In time, we expect Flattr buttons to be added elsewhere, including haiku-files.org and even within individual postings on the website. For now, it's added underneath the piggy bank donation meter, which shows the yearly income from donations. We understand that no single donation processor will meet every person's wants or needs, so we are continuing to adopt multiple options.
