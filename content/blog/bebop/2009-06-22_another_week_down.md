Well another week has passed. I cannot say that to many eventful things have happened with my project. I have been working on getting all of the logic in DriveSetup to work the way I think that it should. I finally connected my development computer up to the network today though and thought I would post a screen shot. The two partitions were created with DriveSetup! Not a whole lot to look at but I pictures are always fun :)
