As anticipated, I was able to do little more than set up my environment during the first stretch of GSOC and the last few weeks of school and my previous internship.  I was able to find computer with a compatible network and graphics card, which should hopefully be faster than running Haiku on a virtual machine on my normal computer.  I also successfully installed haikuporter, although I am having some trouble using it.  I am also trying out an IRC account.

I plan to install SDL 1.2 by the end of this week in order to make sure my environment is properly set up.  I am currently having problems with haikuporter, which is complaining that the ports I wish to install do not exist.  I'm not sure whether there is something else I need to download first or not to get this working; I posted a question about this on the HAIKU-GSOC mailing list.  I hope to also make a stab at writing a .bep file for SDL 1.3; I admit I am not completely certain as to what this involves, but from reading the wiki it looks like it can be described as a python makefile?

Since school and my previous internship are completed, I should make much greater progress over the next few weeks.  I look forward to finally being able to put my full time and effort into this project.
