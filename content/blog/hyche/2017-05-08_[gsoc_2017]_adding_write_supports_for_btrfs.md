<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>My name is Hy (Trac: hyche, freenode IRC: ugen), and this first blog is about my introduction and Btrfs. This is the first time I participate in Google Summer of Code, I also know Haiku through this event. My project in this summer is <b>write supports for Btrfs</b> and my main mentors are <i>mmu_man</i> and <i>tqh</i> (Fredrik Holmqvist).</p>

<p>During the community bonding period, I will </p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up my development environment (userlandfs and fs_shell).</li>
  <li>Dig into the codebase to know more about Haiku kernel, how other support filesystems work and derive it for Btrfs.</li>
  <li>Try to fix issues to get me familiar with the existed works.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Btrfs </h3>
<p>Btrfs (B-tree filesystem) is a filesystem uses <b>B+trees</b> as its main on-disk data structure. It is based on <b>Copy-on-Write</b> (CoW) principle which means it does copy only when a write is necessary. The following works will be implemented to bring off write features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding more Btrfs structures.</li>
  <li>Adding/Modifing tree manipulations (splitting, finding, CoW, etc).</li>
  <li>Implement file/directory operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for now. You can read more details in the reference section.
Bye and have a nice day!
</p>
