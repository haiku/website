# Introduction

Hello! I'm Harshit Sharma (GitHub : harshit-sharma-gits) a 2nd year BTech Undergrad from Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU), Kanpur. I will be working on improving the **Calendar Application** which was developed under GSoC 2017 by Akshay Agarwal.

My mentors for this project are [Niels Sascha Reedijk](https://discuss.haiku-os.org/u/nielx) and [Humdinger](https://discuss.haiku-os.org/u/humdinger).

Here is the link to my [Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCe2aOFJKeP9LJ9ciEifAA8UEvEXHgqZHxY0rKecuS0/edit?usp=sharing)
I am really excited for this project!

# Introduction to the project

A Calendar application is a must have application for any operating system and is beneficial for end users as well as developers. Having a feature-rich Calendar might not sound like a big deal, but it can drastically impact your performance at work and personal life.  

I will be working on below mentioned features :  
- Reminders Utility
- Calendar Profiles
- Search Utility
- CalDav Integration

I have discussed the possibilities of this project with the community, and got some really useful insights on [this](https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/gsoc-22-project-improving-the-calendar-application/12139) thread.  

I would be finalizing the discussion in the upcoming weeks, so suggestion from you all would be highly valuable!  

I would keep the blog updated regarding the progress of the project.
