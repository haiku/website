The goal of this project is to create code for resizing a BFS volume in a safe manner, through the existing volume resizing interface. At first utilized with a command line tool, and toward the end of the summer hopefully integrated with DriveSetup if time allows.

During the community bonding period, I want to get my development environment set up, and gain some basic familiarity with writing to disk. To accomplish that, I'm going to write a small program that can read and write sectors to the hard drive.

I'm also going to read up on documentation and code, in order to get a clear picture of where to begin when I start the coding.

You can check out my submitted proposal at https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/ahenriksson/1 for a brief introduction of me, a technical overview and timeline.
