Saturday, also slept very well, I'm thinking about taking the mattress with me but it won't fit into the plane. and yet I woke up early to participate in a French radio show remotely, that is broadcasted live from the <a href="http://vip2016.popsyteam.org/">Very Important Party</a> (a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoparty">DemoParty</a> I usually attend), for them it's 5pm, but for me it's 8am…

At 10 I'm packing up as I'll have to change the hotel, I just hope I'll sleep as well in the next one. It's much more expensive but that doesn't always scale linearly with the sleep levels!

Finally, someone lets me in, and I find myself in the middle of people setting up for a concert. I actually noticed the "Noise Pancakes" event on their schedule already. I find a seat, pull my laptop, and start running VLC with the microphone as audio input, and the visualization effects sent to the Flaschen-Taschen (they have two, one is 20 by 25 pix, er, bottles, the other is 40 by 45). I also added some funny pictures and messages to the playlist, and played with it throughout the two hours of the event. It was mostly some strange music, although interesting. I did use earplugs though. The pancakes were excellent, btw.

At 2pm we were back to a few, we moved the tables back in place, and started hacking. Some others joined till the evening. I helped my table neighbor apply my VLC patch for the Flaschen-Taschen, and he had a lot of fun with it.

Ok, let's see if the bed is as nice as it looks!
