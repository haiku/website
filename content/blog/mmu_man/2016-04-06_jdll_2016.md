<img src="/files/DSCN3972.JPG" width="25%" height="25%" align="right" alt="">This week-end I went to the <em>Journées du Logiciel Libre</em> (JDLL) to hold the Haiku booth. The JDLL is a local event over two days, mostly focused at general public, with workshops and even a FLOSS gaming room for kids, but also with some highly technical and ethical talks. It also has a room with 3D printers and other maker tools.

The "Linux distro" booths are for some years located on the upper floor, with a little less people but closer to the install-party room, and it's not useless to have a Haiku stand there to remind people that no, GNU/Linux is not the only FLOSS OS around ;-)

Throughout the week-end I had people stopping by, asking about Haiku, and even still some of them fondly remembering BeOS.

I also managed to attend some talks, mostly the keynotes by people such as <a href="https://twitter.com/nitot">Tristan Nitot</a> (ex Mozilla, now at Cozy Cloud (I'll have to look at porting their in-development desktop client…)), <a href="https://twitter.com/laurentchemla">Laurent Chemla</a> (Caliopen).
Although I didn't propose any Haiku-related talk this time, I did participate in the lightning talk session, to show <a href="https://opentoonz.github.io/">OpenToonz</a> running on GNU/Linux (I participated in <a href="https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz/pull/51">the porting effort</a> that made it run in less than a week after the opensourcing, and maybe someday we'll get it on Haiku as well), and also to talk about <a href="http://github.com/mmuman/RadioTimer">the little HTML5 tool I wrote</a> to help me record show for a local radio station.

I also took the opportunity to test some software presented at other stands, like <a href="http://www.ancestris.org/">Ancestris</a>, which is a genealogy suite written in Java, and actually works surprisingly well on our OpenJDK.

I'd just need to figure out why plugins fails to install, and package it!
