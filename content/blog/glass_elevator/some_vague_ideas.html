                    <p> 	Late at night, beating my brains for yet another newsletter article, my eyes were drawn to a notebook nearby my desk. This notebook contains my ideas that I brainstorm for future versions of OBOS. One of the complaints that people have is that R1 as we have defined it has no &quot;future&quot;. It doesn&#39;t do anything beyond recreate what Be did and that we should aim higher for our first release. Interestingly enough, there is another, equal sized crowd of people who say that we are trying to do the impossible. In either case, R1 will be what it will be.   </p><p> R2 and beyond are wide open, though. The following are some bullet items, some thoughts and ideas. Nothing solid, nothing developed, nothing thought through all the way, and <strong>certainly</strong> nothing promised. But some ideas, none the less... </p><p> XML - possibly methods for BMessage to transform to and from XML, possibly a whole different kit </p><p> Encryption - a plug in architecture for encryption/decryption. Probably public/private key. With a key manager of some sort, so that it is easy for users. Also with a tie-in to the Mail Kit of some sort so that mail programs can quickly and easily encrypt and decrypt messages. Also a cache of public keys with methods to refresh them (via Networking Kit) </p><p> Additions to BBitmap - this class is really in need of a lot more &quot;stuff&quot;. Think LeadTools for Windows - the ability to choose some area of the bitmap and apply transforms (plug ins). This has been done a dozen times for a dozen different art programs. Let&#39;s do it once more, possibly leveraging someone else&#39;s work and make it part of the OS. </p><p> In a similar vein, how about a BSound class that adds effects? Mute, slide, reverb, echo, etc. All, again, as plug ins. </p><p> Vastly improved printing is needed. Color management is <strong>huge</strong>, now, with digital photography. Additionally, more functionality is needed. Watermarks, more margin control, etc. All of those &quot;extras&quot; that you have on Windows and use once a year.  </p><p> BHTMLView - I am not sure how this one should be done, but it is just obvious to everyone that we need one. </p><p> Localization - this is probably the single most requested feature. And one of the biggest. Because this ties into so many other things. At minimum, we need to add currency, calendar and number widgets that tie in to the locale. Plus automatic translation support (i.e. translate phrases into current locale&#39;s language), resizeable, font independent widgets, right to left and top to bottom text, etc. There is a *huge* amount of work in doing this right.  </p><p> Game Kit - this kit needs a massive overhaul. Be never really took it seriously, but I do. Sprites, Backgrounds, collision handling, parallax, 3d, scrolling, tiling, AI, controllers (joysticks, etc) and more. This kit could almost be a career for someone. </p><p> IM Kit - I have heard rumours that this is being worked on. Possibly leverage that into our work. This kit could be useful in a dozen different apps. Tech support in your office suite? Inter-player chatting in games? More and more, we are all connected... </p><p> Device Kit - if there is any less cared for kit out there, I don&#39;t know what it is. Only BJoystick (which belongs in Input Kit) and BSerialPort remain. But why does serial port deserve a class but not BParallel? Or BAudioCD? Or BVideoCD? Or Scanners, Cameras, PDAs, etc? Every &quot;thing&quot; that you plug into your BeOS machine should have a class to access it. Banish ioctl()&#39;s forever! </p><p> Tracker - A lot of code clean up to happen here. After that, I would like to experiment with different, alternate Trackers. The desktop metaphor doesn&#39;t work for everyone. I don&#39;t think that anything works for everyone. Let&#39;s make a couple or more different Trackers and see if they suit someone&#39;s needs. </p><p> BClipBoard - ability to have multiple items on the clipboard </p><p> Interface Kit - there are dozens of widgets missing from here. Not to mention all of the stuff we mentioned for internationalization. How about an Outlook bar? Or a grid widget? Lots of honest work to be had, here. </p><p>  Storage Kit - I think that this is a little hard to use. Lots of times, I have found myself taking the long way around on some simple things. Maybe some better methods... </p><p> Support Kit - Lots of new classes for here, too. There are numbers of useful little helper classes that we could all use... How about a pool allocator, as an example. </p><p> DataBase Kit - access for SQL databases will be a large sticking point to getting on the corporate desktop. The sooner the better.  </p><p> Translation Kit - Good kit, as far as it goes. How about 3D objects? Or vectors (structured drawing)? HTML read/write? Tons of good work to be done here, too. </p><p> A CD Writer application is a critical piece that we lack. And a scanning app. Simple stuff that come with other OS&#39;s. </p><p> Power Management and other &quot;special&quot; laptop support </p><p> A dock - every OS should have one of these.  </p><p> As you can see, there are a <strong>ton</strong> of ideas. And I know that every one of you has some, too. These are just mine. R1 is a stepping stone. A place to start. Not a place to end up. I certainly don&#39;t intend to rest on my laurels when R1 is done. I intend to step it up another notch and build what Be didn&#39;t have time to finish.</p><br class="clear" /> </div>        </div>
