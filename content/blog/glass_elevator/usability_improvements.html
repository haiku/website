                    <h2> Usability Improvements </h2> <p>Haiku R1 should be polished and not suffer from BeOS&#39; insufficiencies. If we release a half-baked OS our userbase will turn away. </p><p>This is a summary of many improvements discussed on the GE-list and elsewhere: </p><h2> TODO for R1 </h2> <ul><li> rework window zooming as it often does not work as one would expect </li><li> add BTextView context-menu with &quot;cut&quot;, &quot;copy&quot;, &quot;paste&quot;, &quot;select all&quot;, &quot;undo&quot; </li><li> improve BTextView keyboard-navigation: move to next/previous word, paragraph, beginning/end of file </li><li> show the task switcher <em>immediately</em> upon hitting CTRL+TAB (seems to be an R5 bug which causes a too long delay) </li><li> remove unneeded preferences (menu settings, scrollbar style) </li><li> combine similar preferences apps (Appearance: UI+screen, Input Devices: mouse+keyboard+keymap, Media: audio+video+sounds, Networking: ppp+networking) </li><li>modify apps in the source tree to match modifier key functions for lists: Shift-click selects a range, CTRL-click toggles one item </li><li>parent menu items which don&#39;t have a message associated with them should not close the menu when clicked </li><li> demo apps are not needed by default. why is the clock replicant in the Applications menu? it&#39;s a demo! remove more unneeded apps and make sure all apps sit in the right category (apps vs prefs) </li><li> Tracker: all entries in the date column should have the same width and use the same formatting. no more mixed entries with &quot;Friday&quot; here and &quot;Sat&quot; there. use fixed-width font? </li><li> Tracker: use different cursors for &quot;move&quot; and &quot;copy&quot; </li><li> automatically remove deleted apps from FileTypes DB (it quickly blows up like the Windows registry) </li><li>highlight controls somehow when the mouse moves over them to indicate &quot;clickability&quot; </li><li> Deskbar should be able to reserve screen space for itself (zoomed windows don&#39;t take up that space) </li><li> Tracker: &quot;Identify&quot; action in context-menu should be hidden or moved somewhere else (if identification cannot be automated reliably) </li><li> Deskbar: all items should get a right-click context-menu </li><li> Tracker: remove &quot;Clean Up&quot; action. use a fixed, non-overlapping grid for icons (overlapping icons are evil) </li><li> auto-mount read-only media (at least CDs)</li><li>Tracker: add mouse cursors which indicate a &quot;copy&quot; or &quot;move&quot; operation on drag-n-drop<br /></li></ul><h2> Ideas for R2 </h2> <ul><li> (needs more thought) rework mounting process: create auto-mount-points and always show all mountable volumes. unmounting should be replaced by unloading a complete device (CD, USB drive, etc.). show device icons on desktop. their contents are the mountable volumes. ??By default volumes are auto-unmounted when they not needed, anymore. To permanently keep a volume mounted you drag-n-drop it on the desktop (or maybe a folder?), so you have a permanent mount-point.?? </li><li> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ge.blubinc.com/index.php/Fusing_Tabs" title="http://ge.blubinc.com/index.php/Fusing_Tabs" class="external text">magnetic screen corners</a> (all windows docking to <strong>screen edges</strong> ala Winamp) </li><li> time should always be visible (never overlap Deskbar) </li><li> add screen scaling support (resolution-independent) </li><li> design all apps such that they show more information and less buttons </li><li> less top-menu items and more contextual actions (pop-up menus) and information </li><li> Tracker: when holding down some shortcut-button while clicking an item in the folder-browser context-menu the menu should not close, but open that item in the background (allows for multiple items to be opened) </li><li> add global shortcut support (open folders, apps, actions) ala SpicyKeys and improve keyboard navigation because experienced users are faster with keyboard </li><li> reduce number of servers (audio_server, media_server, media_addons_server, why not just media_server?) </li><li> is separation of Tracker and Deskbar needed? it&#39;s not that I could continue my work if only Deskbar crashes </li><li> Tracker: show size of selected files in current folder as little bubble-window next to mouse pointer (and hide it when mouse exits window frame, so I can quickly check multiple folders). maybe also show size of all files if we have enough space </li><li> Tracker: automatically adjust column-widths when window is resized (see Thunderbird)  </li><li> Deskbar: too inaccessible. I rarely use it because it&#39;s always hidden by max-zoomed windows </li><li> where is the long-discussed simplified and more powerful one-click installer with a package manager and automatic package updates? </li><li> colors should be used more actively in system controls </li><li> search results (BTextView, etc.) should be marked within the scroll bar, so you can quickly scroll to other results (instead of clicking &quot;next&quot;/&quot;prev&quot; buttons) </li><li> mark location of a selection within the scroll bar (or allow for adding marks via scroll-bar?) </li><li> arrange workspaces and desktop as 2D space (navigate via ALT+arrows)? </li><li> Deskbar as clipboard (drag-n-drop anything on it)? </li></ul><br class="clear" /> </div>        </div>
