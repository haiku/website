Hi everyone!
I am the GSoc student to implement the swap file support.

Haven't been here for a long time since I spent a week prepareing for the school's exam. The annoying exam ended yesterday, and now I have time to make some preparations for this summer.

I have got a basic unstanding of the Haiku vm system during the application period. In the next few days, I will investigate how paging is implemented in Linux and FreeBSD (I've stated doing that but was interrupted by the exam)and continue to work on my haiku vm tutorial. :-)

Bye,
Zhao Shuai
