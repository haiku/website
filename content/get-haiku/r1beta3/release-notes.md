**WIP Draft - this has not been finalised! Statistics etc. still need to be updated.**

The third beta for Haiku R1 marks twenty months of hard work to improve Haiku's hardware support and its overall stability. Since Beta 2, there have been 101 contributors with over 2800 code commits in total. More than 900 bugs and enhancement tickets have been resolved for this release.

Please keep in mind that this is beta-quality software, which means it is feature complete but still contains known and unknown bugs. While we are mostly confident in its stability, we cannot provide assurances against data loss.

*To download Haiku or learn how to upgrade from R1/beta2, see "[Get Haiku!](/get-haiku/)". For press inquiries, see "[Press contact](#press-contact)".*
