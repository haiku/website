**WIP Draft - this has not been finalised! Statistics etc. still need to be updated.**

**Todo: Update statistics**
The third beta for Haiku R1 marks twenty months of hard work to improve Haiku's hardware support and its overall stability. Since Beta 2, there have been X contributors with over X code commits in total. More than X bugs and enhancement tickets have been resolved for this release.

Please keep in mind that this is beta-quality software, which means it is feature complete but still contains known and unknown bugs. While we are mostly confident in its stability, we cannot provide assurances against data loss.
