## Upgrading from R1/beta1

There is an upgrade path available for users that are currently using Haiku R1/beta1. If you want to do this upgrade, you will have to use the Terminal (not SoftwareUpdater!) to issue some commmands.

*Warning: only upgrading from Beta 1 is supported. It may be possible to upgrade from prior development images, but this is untested and you may run into unknown problems.*

The following commands will replace your existing "Haiku" and "HaikuPorts" repositories with their R1/beta2 equivalents:

```shell script
pkgman add-repo https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haiku/r1beta2/$(getarch)/current
pkgman add-repo https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haikuports/r1beta2/$(getarch)/current
```

If this is successful, you may then run a `full-sync` to perform the actual upgrade:

```shell script
pkgman full-sync
```

After that step has completed successfully, you should immediately reboot the system. You can do this from the Deskbar, or by running ```shutdown -r``` in Terminal.

### Download a Haiku Image

The provided images are in our `anyboot` format. They can be written directly to a <a href="/guides/installing/making_haiku_usb_stick">USB flash drive</a>, an empty disk, or <a href="/get-haiku/burn-cd">written to DVD</a> media.<br />
The images can be used "live" or used to install Haiku to another disk/partition of your choice.<br />
They can also be used directly from QEMU or installed in other <a href="/guides/virtualizing">virtual machines</a>.

### Direct Download Locations

If you choose to download an image, please select from the list of available mirrors below. Mirrors are in no specific order.

### Torrents

<p>In order to assist with distribution, we have also created .torrent files that can be used to download and seed the release files for others.<br/>
<b>Please continue seeding the torrents if you can!</b></p>
<ul>
 <li><a class="track" href="https://cdn.haiku-os.org/haiku-release/r1beta2/haiku-r1beta2-x86_gcc2h-anyboot.zip.torrent">32-bit</a></li>
 <li><a class="track" href="https://cdn.haiku-os.org/haiku-release/r1beta2/haiku-r1beta2-x86_64-anyboot.zip.torrent">64-bit</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Checksums</h3>

<p>To make sure that you have got the right file and that it has not been corrupted during file transfer, it is always wise to ensure the integrity of your download. To that end, you can use the SHA256 checksums shown below to verify that what you have is the correct file.</p>

</pre>

<p>
	If you are in Haiku, macOS or Linux, you can use the <code>sha256sum</code>
	command from the Terminal to generate a checksum for your downloaded
	file and verify against those above. If you are in Windows, you can use
	a tool such as <a href="https://implbits.com/products/hashtab/" title="Download hashtab">hashtab</a> to display checksums for files directly in explorer.
