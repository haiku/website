This site, which was operated by Jonathan Freeman, has <a href="http://www.freelists.org/archives/openbeos/11-2007/msg00102.html">recently closed its doors</a>, so we felt we needed a replacement. Let me introduce you to <a href="http://haiku-files.org">Haiku Files</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Like HaikuHost.com, Haiku Files is an archive of nightly builds, provided both as hard disk raw and VMware images, and generated by the <a href="http://factory.haiku-os.org/">Haiku Build Factory</a>. The difference is that Haiku Files will keep a much larger archive of builds, allowing testers to fall back to older builds so that it is easier to pin down revision changes that may help in debugging. We are also making the Haiku development tools available for download from here.</p>

<p>Haiku Files is currently online, so check it out at <a href="http://haiku-files.org">haiku-files.org</a>. We want to thank <a href="http://dreamhost.com">DreamHost</a> for generously providing free hosting for this site, as well as Phil "Sikosis" Greenway for putting together and maintaining the backend that generates the nightly images.</p>
