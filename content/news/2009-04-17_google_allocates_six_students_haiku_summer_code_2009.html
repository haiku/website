                    <p>We are pleased to announce that Google has allotted us with six students for this year's Summer of Code program!  This is quite an achievement, seeing as how Google accepted only 1000 students, which is about 10% less than in 2008.  As with the year before, the quality of the proposals submitted by students has increased significantly.  This year, students who applied to Haiku were suggested to fix an issue in our <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org">bug tracker</a>.  This provided our mentors with a glimpse into the students' programming ability, as well as their ambition.  Those contributions, several of which have already been committed to our SVN repository, proved to be a valuable resource when ranking the students.  This allowed our mentors to strike a balance between projects that fill a need in Haiku and projects by students who have also shown themselves to be a worthy <i>Google Summer of Code</i> student.  These students went above and beyond our requirements and expectations.  They gave us hope that come October, November, and beyond, they will still be making contributions to our community.  Since retaining students as community developers is one of the goals of Summer of Code, it weighed heavily in our decision.  Without further ado, here is the list of students who will be sponsored by Google to contribute to Haiku in <i>Google's Summer of Code 2009</i>:</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to continue the hospitality that has always been a part of our community.  This has become a well-earned reputation for the members of Haiku's community.</p>

<p>We would like to take this time to express our gratitude for all students who have submitted project proposals.  Many of you have displayed that your abilities rival those who were accepted.  It is an unfortunate situation that we were not allocated more student slots by Google.  We are looking at ways to express our appreciation of your efforts so far.  In addition we are investigating the possibility of sponsoring another <a href="/community/haiku-code-drive-2008">Haiku Code Drive</a>.  At this point, no decision has been made and we are welcoming comments on regarding this matter.  If you would like feedback regarding your proposal and suggestions for next year, feel free to contact (<a href="/user/331/contact">Matt Madia</a>).</p>

<p>Thank you to all who have and continue to take the time to make Haiku's participation in <i>Google Summer of Code</i> a successful adventure.  This includes Google for sponsoring <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009">Summer of Code</a>, the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/soc/">Melange</a> developers and contributors, and of course <a href="/community/gsoc/2009#mentors">Haiku's Mentors</a>.</p>        </div>
