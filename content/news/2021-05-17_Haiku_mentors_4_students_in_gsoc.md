<p>The list of accepted students for Google Summer of Code 2021 has just been
announced. Over the summer, four students will work on improving Haiku
and related applications, with help from our mentor team. Google gives the
students a stipend, which allows them to work full-time on the project without
the need to find another job.</p>

<p>The goal of the program is to introduce students to the way open source
projects work, and encourage them to become long term contributors. Several
members of the Haiku developer team are indeed former GSoC students.</p>
