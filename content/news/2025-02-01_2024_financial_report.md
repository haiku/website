The Haiku, Inc. [financial report for 2024](https://www.haiku-inc.org/docs/haiku_inc-financial-report-2024.pdf)
is now available on the [Haiku, Inc. Documents page](https://www.haiku-inc.org/documents/).

Our donations for 2024 were higher than any other year, breaking all previous
records by almost $10,000! Even with some reasonably high expenses we still
managed to have a net positive year.

In 2024 our contractor waddlesplash worked the whole year, and we had a new beta
release.

We had some very generous large donations this year, which is part of what made
this a record setting year. One individual in particular donated a total of
$7,500 through GitHub Sponsors, which is extremely generous!

We appreciate every donation, big and small, and every donor plays a role in
helping to keep Haiku moving forward, so again: **thank you so much!**

Bitcoin is at record highs, and so therefore is our Coinbase balance. Though as
noted in the report we still have to sort out details of our Coinbase account to
make those funds more accessible.

Finally, while this is a news item about the financial report, I want to extend
a thanks to all our volunteers as well. While our donors play their part, so do
our volunteers, continuing to improve Haiku on their own time, year after year.
Not just developers, we also have volunteers who help with documentation,
answering questions in the forum, and working on translations. Plus maybe that
person who manages the finances and works on the financial reports...

Thanks to all who help keep Haiku moving forward!
