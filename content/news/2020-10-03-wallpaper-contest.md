One of the most common feedback that we receive is that Haiku needs some nice colourful wallpapers shipping with its releases. We definitely want to improve the current situation. And we need your help.

Haiku currently ships with only one (1) wallpaper, and it's not a complete wallpaper per se, it's just the Haiku logo positioned at fixed coordinates on the screen. To be fair, there is a reason we only use the Haiku logo as the default wallpaper; we want Haiku to be usable on systems that have memory as low as 256 MB, therefore each byte that we can spare counts.

We are looking for artists that can contribute to Haiku with some appealing wallpapers. To be more precise, we are looking for either:

- Vector illustrations
- Painted illustrations

## Guidelines

Artists are free to submit in any category they please. We hope the guidelines below will help:

- Illustrations should be in at least landscape 5K size.
- Vector illustrations should include a "lite" version, to be used as the default wallpaper (see the second paragraph). The colour scheme of this lite variant should blend in with the standard system background colour.
- We encourage painted illustrations to use subtle haiku themes, such as leaves, Far-Eastern typography, and literature. Anime-themed drawings are also welcome, but should there be human characters, they should not be the main focus.
- For vector illustrations, use darker blue tones as the main colour. For painted illustrations, use warmer colours.
- Doodle versions of the Haiku logo are welcome, in-fact we would love to have a coloured Haiku logo doodle for the default wallpaper image (see the part about the lite version).
- Entries should include a note that the work is licensed under [CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) or a similar license.
- Artists are encouraged to name their work as they please, otherwise you would be leaving the naming part to the mercy of the Haiku developers.
- Vector drawings should be in `*.svg` format, and drawings should be in either `*.kra` or `*.xcf` format.

## Submission deadline

There is no strict deadline for the call, we would like you to take as much time as you need. We ould love to include your work in the next beta release. Depending on the number of entries before the release date, a vote might be held at the Haiku forums in each respective category.

Thank you very much for being a part of the Haiku universe!
