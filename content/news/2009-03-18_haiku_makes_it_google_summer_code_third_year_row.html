<strong>Haiku's application for Google Summer of Code 2009&trade; has been accepted!</strong></p>

<p>This year, the role of Haiku's <i>Google Summer of Code</i> primary administrator has been taken up by Matt Madia, with Stephan Aßmus acting as the backup administrator.  Over the past few days, Google program administrators evaluated a total of 395 Mentoring organization applications and published their <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2009">list of those accepted</a> on Wednesday, March 18th 19:00 UTC.  As you may imagine, time had seemingly slowed to a crawl in anticipation of the results!</p>

<p>As usual, we have created a <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/community/gsoc2009/ideas">list of suggested ideas</a>.  We encourage interested students to begin considering possible projects and more importantly to engage yourself in our community!<p>

<p>Here's some anecdotal data involving <i>Google Summer of Code</i> from the past and this year. The number of mentoring organizations has grown from 40 in 2005, to 100, to 130, and up to 175 in 2008.  There were roughly 500
mentoring applications in 2008, however a good portion of those were "spammy"  and does not represent an accurate count of actual applications.  Google's application process this year has greatly reduced the number of "spammy" applications.  The number of participating students in 2005 was 400 and has grown over the years to 1125 as of last year.  For this year, <strong>Google will be establishing a cap of around 1000 students for 2009</strong>.</p>        </div>
