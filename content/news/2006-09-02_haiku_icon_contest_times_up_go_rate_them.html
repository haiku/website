<p>Time is up for the Haiku Icon Contest submissions, and it is now everybody&#39;s chance to make their voice heard. Head over to the <a href="http://iconcontest.bug-nordic.org/iconsets.php">rating page</a>, and tell us what you think about the fourteen gorgeous icon sets that were submitted to the contest. In the rating page you can view the icon sets side by side for comparison purposes, as well as preview each icon set on a <a href="http://iconcontest.bug-nordic.org/visualizer/">virtual desktop</a>.</p>  <p>During the rating period, which lasts until September 23, an open discussion will be held in the <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/openbeos">Haiku mailing list</a>, as a brainstorming exercise that will give us input leading to the final Haiku icon design guidelines. So, everyone has a double opportunity to influence the outcome, one by rating the submitted artwork, and the other through the discussion on the mailing list. The guidelines coming out of the rating and discussions will provide the base for the creation of the final artwork, so be sure to participate in both.</p>  <p>Finally, while no single icon set is expected to be adopted in its entirety, the author of the icon set with the best total rating will be awarded a special mention certificate signed by project leader Michael Phipps; as a small token of appreciation, there will also be a surprise gift from one of our sponsors. The results of the rating will be announced here around the beginning of October.</p>  <p>We want to thank all the artists who submitted their icons to the contest, as well as Petter Holt Juliussen of BeOS User Group Nordic for hosting the rating pages for us.</p>  <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="http://iconcontest.bug-nordic.org/iconsets.php">Go rate them</a>!</p>
