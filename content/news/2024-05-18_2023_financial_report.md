The Haiku, Inc. [financial report for 2023](https://www.haiku-inc.org/docs/haiku_inc-financial-report-2023.pdf)
is now available on the [Haiku, Inc. Documents page](https://www.haiku-inc.org/documents/).

Our donations for 2023 were almost as high as 2021, which was our record year so
far. We pretty much broke even on income vs expenses, which bodes well for the
future. Of course for more detail read the report!

In 2023 our contractor waddlesplash worked the whole year, and efforts are
currently under way to make another beta release.

I want to extend a huge thanks to all our donors, everyone in the project really
appreciates every donation we get. I recently got a check from someone for a
relatively small donation, with a note apologizing that they cannot donate more
right now. It really struck home to me that people passionate about Haiku and
our mission will donate even if it is a bit of stretch. Either way, every little
bit helps!
