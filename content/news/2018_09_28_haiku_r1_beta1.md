After nearly 6 years since R1/alpha4, Haiku R1/beta1 has been released. See "[Release Notes](/get-haiku/release-notes/)" for the (lengthy) release notes, "[Press contact](/get-haiku/release-notes/#press-contact)", for press inquiries ... and "[Get Haiku!](/get-haiku/)" to skip all that and just download the release.
