The Haiku, Inc. [financial report for 2022](https://www.haiku-inc.org/docs/haiku_inc-financial-report-2022.pdf)
is now available on the [Haiku, Inc. Documents page](https://www.haiku-inc.org/documents/).

Our donations for 2022 were almost as high as 2021, which was our record year so
far.

In 2022 our contractor waddlesplash worked the whole year, and we got a Beta 4
release near Christmas due to his efforts as well as from our many other contributors.

I want to extend a huge thanks to all our donors, everyone in the project really
appreciates every donation we get. A lot got done in 2022 and 2023 should be another
great year for Haiku. I won't make any predictions as far as releases are concerned
(I've learned not to do that anymore), but I know Haiku will continue to improve
and become a better system for daily use every month. Much of this is due to the
support of our donors which allows us to pay someone to work on Haiku.
