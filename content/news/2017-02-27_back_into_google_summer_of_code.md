<p>After a two year break, the Haiku project is proud to be part of Google
Summer of Code again. Over the summer, students will work on improving Haiku
and related applications, with help from our mentor team. Google gives the
students a stipend, which allows them to work full-time on the project without
the need to find another job.</p>

<p>The goal of the program is to introduce students to the way open source
projects work, and encourage them to become long term contributors. Several
members of the Haiku developer team are indeed former GSoC students.</p>

<p>If you know people in the right age bracket that might be interested, point them
to the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code site</a> that has all the information.
Or print out our <a href="/community/gsoc">GSoC flyer</a> and hand them out on campus.</p>

<p>Students must submit their application after March 20, but shouldn't wait until
then to start preparing it. The coding period spans over June, July, and August.</p>
