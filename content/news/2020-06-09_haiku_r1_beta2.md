After almost 2 years since R1/beta1, Haiku R1/beta2 has been released. See "[Release Notes](/get-haiku/r1beta2/release-notes/)" for the release notes, "[Press contact](/get-haiku/r1beta2/release-notes/#press-contact)", for press inquiries ... and "[Get Haiku!](/get-haiku/r1beta2/)" to skip all that and just download the release (or upgrade to it from an existing install!)
