                    <p>The application period for the Google Summer of Code 2007 is close, and as Haiku prepares to submit its application to attempt becoming a mentor organization, we are initiating a drive with the goal engaging the Haiku community at large. We will be submitting our application on March 5th or 6th, and expect to know whether our application has been accepted on March 14th, the day that Google is scheduled to announce the accepted mentoring organizations on <a href="http://code.google.com">code.google.com</a>. Please check out our <a href="/community/gsoc/2007">GSoC 2007 Drive</a> page to see what you can do to help raise our chances of making it into GSoC 2007!</p>        </div>
