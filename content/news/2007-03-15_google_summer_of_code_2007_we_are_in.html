                    <p>We are pleased and at the same time thrilled to inform the community that Google has accepted our application to become a mentor organization for the Google Summer of Code 2007. Yes, we have made it! Students now have until March 24 to apply for any of our project ideas from the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-announce/web/guide-to-the-gsoc-web-app-for-student-applicants">GSoC Web App for Student Applicants</a>. If you are a student and are interested in working on one of our project ideas, please check out our <a href="/community/gsoc2007/ideas">List of GSoC Ideas</a> and <a href="/community/gsoc2007/students">Students: How to Apply</a> pages for detailed information.</p>

<p>To the existing Haiku community, please be welcoming and supportive of the students pursuing working with Haiku for the GSoC: after all, their success will be our success too.</p>        </div>
