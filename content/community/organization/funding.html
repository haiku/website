<p>The Haiku project itself is not a formal entity, and as a result it cannot
accept donations directly. There are however various way to donate, either to
an organization or directly to some developers.</p>

<h2>Haiku, Inc</h2>

<p><a href="http://haiku-inc.org">Haiku, inc</a> is an US-based non-profit
organization which handles donations to the Haiku project. They fund the
infrastructure (servers, hosting), communication (stickers, flyers) as well
as travel and hosting costs for people representing Haiku at open source
conferences (FOSDEM, RMLL, ...) or attending coding sprints. They also
hold the Haiku and Haiku logo trademarks.</p>
<p>Extra funds are sometimes allocated to buying specific hardware to
help a developer write a driver for it, or to fund specific developments,
allowing contributors to work full-time on a specific task.</p>
<p>Visit the inc website for a more detailed report of the funded activities.</p>

<p>Haiku, inc accepts donations through bank transfers, paypal, amazon payments,
flattr, and bitcoins.</p>

<h2>Haiku Support Association</h2>

<p><a href="http://haiku-support-association.org/index-eng.html">The HSA</a> 
is another non-profit collecting donations to help the Haiku project. They
are based in germany. Their main contribution to Haiku is funding "code sprint"
events, where developers gather in the same room to work together on the project.</p>

<p>The HSA accepts donations by bank transfers.</p>

<h2>Liberapay</h2>

<p>Liberapay is an initiative for funding open source developers and other people
or organizations. Unlike other similar platforms, they collect no fees on
donations. Instead, they are themselves funded by donations on their own platform.</p>

<p>Some Haiku developers and contributors have a Liberapay account and accept
donations. There is currently no organization-wide account, so you will have
to direct your donations to specific developers.</p>

<h2>Bountysource</h2>

<p>Bountysource is a "bounty" platform. They allow people to fund work on specific
features. The developer implementing the feature gets the funds.</p>

<p>Bountysource imports tickets from the Haiku bugtracker, so any bug reported
there can be attached to a bounty.</p>
