<p>The Haiku Project is proud to work with other organisations on social initiatives to get more young and
marginalized people involved in the open source community. They are a great opportunity for people to get
started with working on top of the Haiku platform, as well as open source development in general.</p>

<h2>Google Summer of Code | Google, Inc. </h2>
<p>The <a href="/community/gsoc">Google Summer of Code&trade;</a> is a program that offers student developers stipends
to write code for various open source projects. Haiku made its debut as a mentoring organization in 2007, and has since
been chosen to participate every year. Participating in the Google Summer of Code has not only meant getting fresh code
for many different areas of Haiku, but has also translated into community growth, as several former Google Summer of
Code students have become active long-term Haiku contributors over time.</p>

<h2>Google Code-In | Google, Inc. </h2>
<p><a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Google Code-In&trade;</a> was the little brother of the Summer
of Code which targeted younger students - 13 to 17 years old - and consisted of many small tasks that were suitable for
that age group. Every student that completed at least one task got a certificate and for at least three tasks additionally a
t-shirt. Some additional prizes were awarded to top performing students. The top two students per organization were invited
to visit the Google headquarters after each competition.</p>

<h2>VALS Semester of Code | Virtual Alliances for Learning Society</h2>
<p>"Its goal is to connect higher education students with open source projects to introduce them to the cooperative nature
of working within a group on a bigger project. For Haiku, besides potentially extending its feature set, it's another
opportunity to spark the interest of new, eager developers with a chance to gain future regular contributors."</p>

<h2>Haiku Code Drive | Haiku, Inc.</h2>
<p>The <a href="/community/hcd">Haiku Code Drive</a> was a program designed to raise funds from the community in order
to sponsor students to produce code for Haiku. The Haiku Code Drive program specifically targeted student candidates that
applied for Haiku but could not make it into the Google Summer of Code. We were offering them a U$2,500 stipend per
successfully completed project.</p>
