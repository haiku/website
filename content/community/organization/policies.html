<p>The standards that govern the Haiku community are similar to the <em>Unwritten Constitutions</em> that govern some countries, where their constitution simply acts as an aggregation of other laws, rather than a standalone constitution.</p>

<p>The policies of the HaikuProject are listed below in aggregation:</p>

<HR>
<h2>Trademarks and Copyrights</h2>

<h4>Trademark Policy</h4>
<p>Haiku, Inc. owns the 'Haiku'® name, HAIKU logo®, HAIKU Background Leaf™, and HAIKU Leaf™ (registered) trademarks. As an open source project, the name and brand that is associated with the Project is vital to the Project's reputation and the sense of familiarity that end-users expect from the Software. Anyone is able to freely use the code that comprises Haiku, however the trademarks of Haiku cannot freely be used in the same liberal manner.</p>

<p>The <a href="/about/trademark_policy">Trademark Policy</a> page on the about section of this website contains the latest policy revision.</p>

<h4>Haiku Distro Guidelines</h4>
<p>The Haiku project believes that having one distribution (the one officially released by the project) is the best long term strategy to ensure success of the platform. Therefore anyone considering creating a new distribution should think long and hard before doing so. The project is very interested in working with anyone who feels they need a new distribution to add what they need to Haiku itself.</p>

<p>The <a href="/community/guidelines_creating_haiku_distribution">Haiku Distro Guidelines</a> page on the about section of this website contains the latest policy revision regarding the creation of a Haiku distribution.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<h4>Nightly images of Haiku</h4>
<p>Nightly images of Haiku contain the latest enhancements, bug fixes, and hardware support. Please keep in mind that there may also be regressions and broken features in these builds which have not yet been identified or resolved. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</p>

<p>When using Nightly images of Haiku, the GCC 2 Hybrids are recommended, as they are the most similar to official releases. Developers who choose to release software that requires a nightly build, are requested to provide a build for the latest stable nightly image.</p>

<h4>Coding Guidelines</h4>
<p>The information in our <a href="/development/coding-guidelines">Coding Guidelines</a> is extremely important. If you will be contributing code or patches to Haiku, you will need to strictly follow the code style guidelines. Code which doesn't follow these guidelines will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Some code doesn't match our guidelines in some places, this is mostly due to it being written before the guidelines were defined. Assistance with cleaning up incorrect code is very welcome as long as you notate in the commit that there are "no functional changes" in this patch (don't bury code changes in style fixes).</p>

<HR>
<h2>Communication</h2>

<h4>General rules</h4>

<p>Be nice to other people. Avoid insults and personal attacks.
In case someone has innapropriate behavior, raise the issue to members of the
Haiku development team, or at the last resort get in touch with contact@haiku-inc.org .
</p>

<p>Appropriate action will be taken, which can range from a warning for the user,
to banning from the forums and mailing lists or removal of commit access for
developers.</p>

<h4>The Haiku Fourms</h4>

<p>Users are to refrain from delving into discussions about religion, politics,
gender, ethnicity, etc. Try to stick to vi vs. emacs for off-topic fun...
We reserve the right to moderate or remove posts of an aggravating nature.</p>

<p>Please, don't use the forum to advertise your non-Haiku related project or
business; if you do, your post will be deleted.</p>

<h4>Mailing List Etiquette</h4>
<p>As with many other FOSS mailing lists, we at Haiku hold ourselves to a few rules when posting to mailing lists. For now most of the rules of <a href="/community/ml/etiquette">Mailing List Etiquette</a> are to ensure that all information is properly archived or to improve a message's readability.</p>

<h4>Bug Tracker Etiquette</h4>
There are a few <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/BugTrackerEtiquette">social rules</a> that are expected to be observed by all contributors of ​Haiku's Bug Tracker.
