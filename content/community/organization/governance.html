The following organisations are the driving force behind the open source development of Haiku:

<HR>

<h2>The Haiku development team</h2>

<p>A group of people known as the <em>development team</em> runs and manages the project.
They have the permissions to edit and triage tickets on the bug tracker, push and merge
code to the repositories, and also get voting rights in important project decisions.</p>

<p>The development team is not a legal entity, but a group of people managing the technical
aspects of the project: coding guidelines, tools to use for collaboration, and general
direction of the development of Haiku.</p>

<p>People are invited to become part of the development team after they have contributed
sufficient work (for example in the form of patches, bug reports submissios, ...)
and show a good understanding of the "Haiku Way" (the overall direction of the project
and the way we collaborate). On the initiative of existing members of the team, a proposal is
sent to the <a href="/community/ml">haiku-development mailing list</a> where the team members can veto it for a period
of 15 days. If the proposal gets enough support and no one has objections, the membership
becomes effective.</p>

<p>The list of the team members and their contact addresses are listed <a href="https://review.haiku-os.org/admin/groups/3,members">on Gerrit</a>.</p>

<h2>Haiku, Inc.</h2>
<p><a href="https://haiku-inc.org">Haiku, Inc.</a> Is a US based Not-for-Profit Organization that was founded in July of 2003 by the founder, long time leader, and visionary of the Haiku Project, Michael Phipps. Its aim is to support the Haiku Project and to further the development of the operating system and its online community.</p>

<p>Haiku, Inc. is usually not involved in technical decisions and is doing mostly administrative work. Their main decision power is on allocating funds to various tasks such as development
contracts or buying some hardware or software needed by developers for specific tasks.</p>

<h2>Haiku Support Association (HSA)</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://haiku-support-association.org/index-eng.html">Haiku Support Association</a> is a German based organisation of users and developers of Haiku. Their objective is to promote the development and further adoption of Haiku, which is done by focusing their efforts on organizing the regularly held BeGeistert event and its associated CodeSprint.</p>

<h2>HaikuPorts</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports">HaikuPorts</a> is Team of Haiku users, developers and contributors who are cooperating towards porting applications and libraries to Haiku.</p>

<h2>HaikuArchives</h2>

<p><a href="https://haikuarchives.github.io">Haiku Archives</a> is a project to collect the sourcecode of currently unmaintained BeOS and Haiku applications, contact the original authors to get their permission to relicense the code under free software licenses if possible, and provide some maintenance and improvements on the code.</p>
