The following organisations are the driving force behind the open source development of Haiku:

<HR>

<h2>The Haiku development team</h2>

<p>A group of people known as the <em>development team</em> runs and manages the project.
They have the permissions to edit and triage tickets on the bug tracker, push and merge
code to the repositories, and also get voting rights in important project decisions.</p>

<p>The development team is not a legal entity, but a group of people managing the technical
aspects of the project: coding guidelines, tools to use for collaboration, and general
direction of the development of Haiku.</p>

<p>People are invited to become part of the development team after they have contributed
a sufficient amount of work (e.g. sending patches, submitting bug reports, writing documentation, etc.)
and appear to understand the "Haiku Way" (a term we use to describe our philosophy, the overall direction of the project
and the way we collaborate). On the initiative of existing members of the team, a proposal is
sent to the <a href="/community/ml">haiku-development mailing list</a> where the team members can veto it for a period
of 15 days. If the proposal gets enough support and no one has objections, the membership
becomes effective.</p>

<p>The list of the team members and their contact addresses are listed <a href="https://review.haiku-os.org/admin/groups/3,members">on Gerrit</a>.</p>

<h2>Haiku, Inc.</h2>
<p><a href="https://haiku-inc.org">Haiku, Inc.</a> is a US-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was originally founded by Michael Phipps— the founder, visionary and long-time leader of the Haiku project— in July 2003. Its objective is to support the Haiku Project, the development of the Haiku operating system, as well as the online community revolving around it.</p>

<p>Haiku, Inc. is usually not involved in technical decisions and is doing mostly administrative work. Their main decision power is on allocating funds to various tasks such as development
contracts or buying some hardware or software needed by developers for specific tasks.</p>

<h2>Haiku Support Association (HSA)</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://haiku-support-association.org/index-eng.html">Haiku Support Association</a> is a German based organisation of users and developers of Haiku. Their objective is to promote the development and further adoption of Haiku, which is done by focusing their efforts on organizing the regularly held BeGeistert event and its associated CodeSprint.</p>

<h2>HaikuPorts</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports">HaikuPorts</a> is a project consisting of of Haiku users, developers and contributors that tries to get applications and software libraries that are available on other operating systems working on Haiku.</p>

<h2>HaikuArchives</h2>

<p><a href="https://haikuarchives.github.io">Haiku Archives</a> is a software preservation project revolving around the search, the collection, the archival and the maintenance of old and unmaintained applications designed for BeOS and Haiku. Contacting the original authors of the applications in order to get their permission to relicense their code with free-software licenses is also included among its duties.</p>
