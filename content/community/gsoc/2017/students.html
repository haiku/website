<h3>Student Application Mini-FAQ</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where do I apply?</strong><br />Start from the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code site</a></li>
<li><strong>What ideas can I apply for?</strong><br />You can suggest your own idea(s) or check out our <a href="/community/gsoc/2017/ideas">List of Google Summer of Code Ideas</a></li>
<li><strong>What info do you need in the application?</strong><br />See the <a href="#template">Application Template</a> below for reference</li>
<li><strong>What if I still have questions?</strong><br />Send a message to the <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/haiku">Haiku Mailing List</a> or contact Haiku's <i>Google Summer of Code</i> administrator (<a href="https://discuss.haiku-os.org/users/pulkomandy">Adrien Destugues</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Are there any other requirements?</strong><br /><strong>Applying students are required to submit a code contribution</strong> to our <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/">bugtracker</a>. This could either be a <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&summary=~easy">task marked easy</a>, <a href="http://xref.plausible.coop/source/search?q=TODO&defs=&refs=&path=&hist=&project=haiku">TODO commented in code</a>, <a href="/development/coding-guidelines">Code style cleanup</a>, or any other unlisted task. Submitting code that relates to your project will indicate a higher level of understanding and ability. The number and difficulty of resolved issues will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application. It is suggested to <strong>include the keyword "gsoc2017" on tickets</strong> that contain submissions, as this facilitates finding them in the future.</li>
<!-- TODO link to queries for past year submissions, to show it is not that hard -->
<li><strong>Why do you want a code contribution before I'm accepted?</strong><br />
This serves several purposes. It displays that you have the most basic skills that are required: building Haiku from source, running Haiku either natively or inside a VM, and using tools for online collaboration (bug tracker, mailing lists, IRC, etc.). More importantly, it provides our mentors with some insight into each individual student's motivation and abilities. It is an opportunity for you, the student to showcase yourself and to <strong>convince us that you are indeed the right person for the job.</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Should I use Haiku R1/A4 or a newer nightly image?</strong><br />
R1 alpha 4 was released in November 2012 and is <b>no longer</b> recent enough for development purposes.
Please use a <a href="https://download.haiku-os.org/nightly-images/x86_gcc2_hybrid/">GCC 2 Hybrid nightly image</a>.
A GCC 2 Hybrid is the current release style for Haiku. It can run and compiled both GCC 2 and GCC 4 code. These nightly images also contain our new package management features which are missing from alpha 4 build. In the event that a new stable build is released before the start of GSoC, you should use that instead.

<h3>Making a Positive Impression</h3>
<p>In open source work, communication is the key. You will be working remotely, and will need to communicate with your mentor, and other members of the Haiku community, over the Internet. Show us you're able to work this way and interact with other Haikuers in a productive and efficient way.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/SubmittingPatches">Submit a patch</a>:
<ul>
<li><strong>that relates to your project</strong></li>
<li>is quality code that conforms to our <a href="/development/coding-guidelines">Coding Guidelines</a></li>
<li>feel free to submit more than one patch!</li>
</ul>
<li>
<li>Have a positive impact on mailing lists, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org">bug tracker</a>, and other public spaces</li>
<li>Do your homework ; Show that you have:
<ul>
<li>researched your project</li>
<li>an understanding of what needs to be done</li>
<li>a proper plan for accomplishing it, which includes quantifiable goals and timelines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Submit an alternate proposal, as this provides our mentors with flexibility for choosing the best students, rather than the best project ideas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Words of Advice</h3>
<p>
Reading and following this advice will do wonders for ensuring
that your <i>Google Summer of Code</i> experience will be something to be proud of.
</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Dedicate at least 30 hours per week</strong><br />
  As <i>Google Summer of Code</i> is essentially a work-from-home internship,
  you are expected to put in the necessary time. To note, the majority of
  Haiku's students who spent less than 30 hours per week, failed.
</li>

<li><strong>Communicate every other day</strong><br />
  The haiku-gsoc mailing list is to be used at all times by you.
  Provide regular reports. Nothing formal, just one or two lines.
  It is important for your mentors to have a clear picture of what you are doing, have done, and plan to do.
  While being self-sufficient is a worthwhile trait, it is not an ideal trait for a Google Summer of Code participant -- Haiku expects you to utilize our mentors, that is why they are there.
</li>

<li><strong>Provide code frequently</strong><br />
  There is a saying in open source -- commit often, commit frequently.
  Take that advice to heart.
  Smaller patches and code snippets are easier for the mentors to review.
  It also gives them more chances to suggest better approaches and keep you on target.
  In turn, this will make you more productive and more likely to succeed!
</li>

<li>
<strong>When you do not have code, it is even more critical to converse frequently.</strong><br />
  If you aren't coding, what are you doing?
  How are you moving closer to your goal?
  What problems are you analyzing?
  What questions and ideas do you have?
</li>

</ol>

<a id="passorfail" name="passorfail"></a>
<h3>Pass or Fail Criteria</h3>

<p>As you know, <i>Google Summer of Code</i> has three monthly evaluation points.
If you happen to receive
a failing mark at either point, you are not paid that portion and your
internship comes to an abrupt end. There are two areas
that are considered during the evaluation: the code output and
communication/interactions.
</p>

<p>
  A word of caution -- do not expect to make miracles during the week
  of mid-term or final evaluations. Instead, expect your mentor to
  evaluate your progress on the first day of the window.
</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Code.</strong><br />
  This includes everything from 'commit worthy' patches to all the code
  (and non-code, such as design documents or pseudo code) leading up to
  that polished patch. In other words, if for some reason you and your
  mentor pursue an approach that turns out to be a dead end you will not
  be punished.
</li>

<li><strong>Communication.</strong><br />
  This includes discussions on the haiku-gsoc list,
  talking with haiku mentors on IRC,
  posting the Milestone Blog/Email Reports.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  In other words, <strong>you will be writing code and talking with
  one or more mentors on a daily basis.</strong> Anything less will
  hurt your mid-term and final evaluation! Do not expect to be able
  to cram days, weeks, or months of work into a shorter period and
  receive a passing evaluation.
