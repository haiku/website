<h3>Applications</h3>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Extend the Network Preferences Application</h4>
Last years GSoC has brought us a new Network Preflet. It can be used to configure the devices of the system for DHCP or manual settings. Extend the applet to support profiles (named sets of settings). Integrate more settings types (at least PPP, maybe prepare for WiFi).
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/820">#820</a></li>
<li>Skill set: networks, UI development, usability basics</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Bluetooth Preferences Application</h4>
A Bluetooth stack is actively being developed by Oliver Ruiz Dorantes. The preference application would configure the stack and its services. It would be a first test case for the stack.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: teamwork, UI development, usability basics</li>
</ul>


<a id="drivers" name="drivers"></a>
<h3>Drivers</h3>
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Add DVD-RAM support to the CD driver</h4>
It should be possible to use DVD-RAM media like a hard disk, including write support. Another useful extension would be Mount Rainier support for CD/DVD-RWs which allows for a similar usage.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1047">#1047</a>, and <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1085">#1085</a> for Mount Rainier</li>
<li>Skill set: kernel and driver development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">ExpressCard with hotplugging support</h4>
Implement a bus manager for the ExpressCard slot. While we already have initial support for its preceding technology CardBus, ExpressCard support is missing yet.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1086">#1086</a></li>
<li>Skill set: kernel and driver development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Finish USB OHCI support</h4>
Our USB stack currently only supports UHCI (Intel), and EHCI (USB 2.0) style USB chipsets. OHCI is found in many chipsets, though, and is still often used for USB 1.1 devices on a USB 2.0 interface. There is already much code written for OHCI. The UHCI/EHCI implementations can be regarded as examples on how to talk to our USB stack.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1044">#1044</a></li>
<li>Skill set: kernel and driver development</li>
</ul>


<a id="kernel" name="kernel"></a>
<h3>Kernel</h3>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement paging (swap file) support</h4>
Try to intelligently handle the free space and the swap file (eventually allowing several swap files, or the reuse of other system's swap partitions - note suspend-to-disk issues with that), have a look at page compression, etc.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1972">#1972</a></li>
<li>Skill set: kernel development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement using HPET timers and other mechanisms than TSC for time keeping</h4>
On CPUs that are able to change their frequency, the TSC increment is not invariant. Therefore, we cannot use it to compute time on these machines. Unfortunately, most recent CPUs are affected due to power saving features.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1993">#1993</a></li>
<li>Skill set: kernel and driver development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Enable the kernel to run as a userland process on top of itself</h4>
Having a virtual userland kernel running on top of itself or another operating system like Linux or BeOS can greatly benefit kernel development and code profiling.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1102">#1102</a></li>
<li>Skill set: kernel development</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement a layered file system extension architecture</h4>
The architecture should allow to transparently extend file systems with features like BeOS attributes and query support, write support, and data encryption.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1933">#1933</a></li>
<li>Skill set: kernel and file system development</li>
</ul>


<a id="media" name="media"></a>
<h3>Media</h3>
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Add encoding support to our MediaKit</h4>
The current media add-on API only supports decoding media. An API for encoding has to be created that fulfills all modern requirements (ie. B-frames). Furthermore, the existing encoders should be extended to export their functionality using this API.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1043">#1043</a></li>
<li>Skill set: You should have an interest in media encoders and should have experience in designing APIs. A knowledge of encoding algorithms is not needed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Write a DV media node</h4>
Last years GSoC has brought us a port of the FreeBSD firewire stack. The next logical step is to write a media node implementing DV input/output by interfacing with the new firewire stack. The node would automatically detect hot plugging of DV equipment and provide the means to access this equipment via the Media Kit APIs.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: kernel/driver development, FireWire protocol, Haiku Media Kit</li>
</ul>



<a id="network" name="network"></a>
<h3>Network</h3>
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement ICMP error handling and propagation</h4>
The current stack implementation lacks a mechanism to deliver ICMP error messages to the protocols, and also to produce ICMP error messages on behalf of the protocol implementations. ICMP error handling would need to be implemented in the IPv4, TCP, and UDP protocols.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/800">#800</a>, and possibly <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1073">#1073</a></li>
<li>Skill set: network protocols, kernel level development experience probably helps</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Integrate our PPP implementation</h4>
Port the PPP implementation to our new network stack. Add phone-line modem support, including HDLC framing and VJC compression (porting both algorithms is sufficient, but make sure the license is compatible to MIT). Implement CHAP authentication. Find and fix bugs.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/812">#812</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/869">#869</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/873">#873</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/922">#922</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/923">#923</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1059">#1059</a>, maybe: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1057">#1057</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1058">#1058</a></li>
<li>Skill set: multi-threading basics, maybe network protocols and some kernel/drivers development, maybe UI development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement ZeroConf/Bonjour support</h4>
It's sufficient to port an existing solution. Options include <a href="http://developer.apple.com/networking/bonjour/index.html">Apple's Bonjour implementation</a> or <a href="http://avahi.org/">Avahi</a>, though Apple's is probably preferred since it has a license more compatible with Haiku's MIT license.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1042">#1042</a></li>
<li>Skill set: network protocols, maybe kernel development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">WiFi support (big task)</h4>
Design a WiFi stack API, and implement it. There is lots of code to look at and/or port in OpenBSD. Also, the recently adopted WiFi stack in the Linux kernel could help with the design.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1050">#1050</a></li>
<li>Skill set: network stack development, WiFi protocols, kernel/driver development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement IPv6 support (big task)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Skill set: IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, kernel and network stack development</li>
</ul>



<a id="user-interface" name="user-interface"></a>
<h3>User Interface</h3>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Identify and fix performance bottlenecks in our app_server</h4>
While we did try to choose the right methods to make our app_server fast, we did not optimize it at all yet. Make sure the server threads use their full thread quantum, remove potential lock contentions, improve drawing speed.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1074">#1074</a></li>
<li>Skill set: UI development, multi-threaded programming, algorithms, you know how to use a profiler</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement subpixel anti-aliasing for font rendering in our app_server</h4>
This task requires understanding the rendering pipeline and Anti-Grain Geometry rendering backend which is used in the Haiku app_server. If done properly, the subpixel anti-aliasing could also extend to any vector shapes drawn by the app_server. The actual implementation of the feature is not going to result in much added code, the challenge is more in understanding the existing framework and how to change it to support the feature.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: following codepaths, understanding lowlevel designs in app_server and AGG</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Multi-monitor support for the app_server</h4>
The app_server needs to handle multiple monitors in its internal screen representation and configuration. The drawing call dispatching would need to be split up, so that drawing commands are dispatched to different Accelerants.<br>
To ease development, having two graphics cards in your computer is recommended, as none of the existing Haiku drivers currently support dual head output correctly (as the accelerant interface does not define a way to use it).
<ul>
<li>Skill set: graphics drivers, application design, AGG</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Hardware 3D acceleration</h4>
Design or port an existing 3D driver interface. See for example the <a href="http://www.tungstengraphics.com/wiki/index.php/Gallium3D">Gallium3D</a> project. Another option is to write a compatibility layer to load binary Linux 3D graphics drivers. There should probably still be our own 3D acceleration API for drivers.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: graphics drivers, API design</li>
</ul>


<a id="other" name="other"></a> 
<h3>Other</h3>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement XSI semaphore and IPC API</h4>
Implement the functionality exposed by the <i>sys/ipc.h</i>, <i>sys/sem.h</i>, and <i>sys/shm.h</i> headers. This will probably need some work in the kernel itself.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1980">#1980</a></li>
<li>Skill set: good C/C++, and eventually a bit of kernel development knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Expand our automated unit tests</h4>
Port a complete POSIX testing framework and add missing unit tests for the Haiku API. You might also port a network stack testing framework.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/61">#61</a></li>
<li>Skill set: good C/C++ knowledge</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Create a CIFS implementation</h4>
Implement a file system add-on to be able to mount Windows network shares. File systems can be developed and debugged in <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/documents/dev/running_userlandfs">userland</a> for Haiku. Mounting shares from the command line would already be a great success, but the project could be rounded off with a "Connect to Server" type of GUI which also remembers previous connections.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: good C and POSIX knowledge</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Help with the CUPS port</h4>
Developer Ithamar Adema is working on a port of CUPS to integrate it with the Haiku printing kit.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: good C and POSIX knowledge</li>
</ul>
