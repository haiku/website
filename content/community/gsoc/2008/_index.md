<p>The Google Summer of Code 2008 is on, and we are part of it again this year. Thanks to the participation of various individuals in the community, particularly our GSoC admin Bruno G. Albuquerque and those who volunteered to become mentors, we have been accepted as a mentor organization for second year in a row. Once again, we are joining <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">this many open source projects</a> chosen by Google to take part in this great program.</p>

<h3>What is the Google Summer of Code and why does Haiku want to participate?</h3>

<p>The Google Summer of Code is a program that offers students stipends to write code for open source projects. Participation in this program gives Haiku an opportunity to have one or more developers that contribute to our code base for a period of three months. It also can help grow our pool of developers, as it is not uncommon for the participating students to stay with the project after the program is completed. Finally, it raises our visibility in the open source world, something that can have a positive effect in raising the profile of the project.</p>

<h3>Current status of the program</h3>

<p>The Haiku developers have come up with a <a href="/community/gsoc/2008/ideas">list of ideas</a> for students to choose from or to base their proposals on. The candidate students have already finished submitting their applications, and the Haiku mentors are currently in the process of reviewing and ranking them. All student proposals will be matched with a mentor by April 18, and the final list of accepted students and their projects will be announced on April 21 (12 noon US PDT).

<h3>How you can help Haiku in GSoC</h3>

<p>You can help by providing assistance to the students on the mailing list and on the Haiku IRC channel. Making the students feel comfortable with the community is important, as it can help them do a better job at reaching their GSoC goals, and could also be the key to students staying with the project even after their GSoC assignment is over.</p>
