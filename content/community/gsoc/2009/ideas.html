<h3>Applications</h3>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Updating AbiWord</h4>
A current <a href="http://www.abisource.com/">AbiWord</a> port is being hosted at <a href="http://dev.osdrawer.net/projects/show/abiword">OSDrawer : AbiWord Project Page</a>.  The student is responsible for determining which aspects of this project to persue.<ul>

<li>Skill set: UI development, usability basics </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Updating VideoLAN</h4>
Currently, Haiku only has a BeOS binary of <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN</a> 0.86.  This project could include porting the necessary dependencies, listed at <a href="http://ports.haiku-files.org/wiki/media-video/vlc">Haiku Ports : VLC Dependency Tracker</a>, and updating the GUI to function with VLC's current codebase.  
<ul>

<li>Skill set: teamwork, build systems, UI development, usability basics</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Updating WebKit and Help In Creating a Native Haiku Web Browser</h4>
Haiku's port of <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> needs to be improved and completed. Plus a native Haiku web browser needs to be written to make use of this port. Students interested in this will be working closely with mentor Ryan Leavengood to design and implement a simple first version of this browser, heavily inspired by Google Chrome. They will also help with designing a BHTMLView class to be used by other parts of Haiku.

Previous BeOS browser projects may also be useful references: <a href="http://themis.sourceforge.net/">Themis</a> and <a href="http://netoptimist.sourceforge.net/">NetOptimist</a>.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: teamwork, c++, UI development, usability basics </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Updating NetSurf</h4>
<a href="http://www.netsurf-browser.org/">NetSurf</a> has a fairly basic port for Haiku.  Numerous aspects could be improved, including but not limited to the GUI, implementing bookmarks, file cache, downloads, printing, preference panels. Some of this work overlaps with the native browser project. <a href=" http://www.netsurf-browser.org/developers/gsoc/2009ideas">Click here</a> to see NetSurf's <i>Google Summer of Code</i> project ideas page, which includes some suggestions for the Haiku port.<ul>

<!-- commenting OpenOffice Port -->
<!--
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">OpenOffice Port</h4>
A large scale project, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> is one of the top open source office suites.  Since no port for Haiku is available, this project would first involve addressing issues for all necessary dependencies and modifying their build system to recognize Haiku as a valid target.  After that, other build time issues would be addressed until a functional build is produced.<ul>
<li>Skill set:  teamwork, build systems</li>
</ul>

<!-- commenting Scribus -->
<!--
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Scribus Desktop Publishing Port </h4>
<a href="http://www.scribus.net/">Scribus Desktop Publishing</a> is another open source office application.  A Haiku port has not yet been started.  The student would be responsible for initiating a port, which includes third-party dependencies, modifying build systems as needed, and progressing through compile time errors to produce a functional build.<ul>
<li>Skill set: teamwork, build systems</li>
</ul>
-->
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Creating Services Kit</h4>
<a href="http://dev.osdrawer.net/projects/show/serviceskit">Services Kit</a> would expose web services to other Haiku applications.  Such web services could include Last.fm, Facebook, or Twitter.  Students interested in this project will work with the mentor to implement the base code, the Twitter protocol, and a replicant to update the Twitter status.  The base code includes the necessary utility functions such as HTTP/HTTPS protocol, URL formatting, and computing MD5 hashes.  Another aspect of this project could include creating a preflet application for managing a user's account information.  
<ul>
<li>Skill set: UI development, usability basics, C++, API design, some experience with HTTP/HTTPS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drivers</h3>
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Enhance USB Webcam</h4>
It is desired to refactor the USB Webcam driver to allow easier compilation on other operating systems.  This will allow Haiku and other operating systems to benefit from each other's work more readily.  In addition, there are numerous bugs to be resolved as well as adding support for a nearly endless supply of webcams.  
<ul>
<li>Skill set: teamwork, kernel, and driver development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">USB Video (UVC)</h4>
This driver will support higher end webcams and other devices.  This should be designed with portability to other OSes, which encourages the re-use of coding efforts for both Haiku and non-Haiku operating systems.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: teamwork, kernel, and driver development</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kernel</h3>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Enable the kernel to run as a userland process on top of itself</h4>
Having a virtual userland kernel running on top of itself or another operating system like Linux or BeOS can greatly benefit kernel development and code profiling.

<!--
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">DriveSetup </h4>
DriveSetup is Haiku's partitioning tool.  As of now, it only supports initializing existing partitions or entire disk drives as BFS.  There is no support for managing partitions, which primarily includes creation, deletion, and modifying.  Most of the user-space application aspects require additional structures in the kernel to be implemented.

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Develop a successor to BFS</h4>
Numerous technologies can be implemented for BFS to improve it's functionality on both mechanical and solid state disks. These include transparent compression, allocate-on-flush, online defragmentation, sparse files, delayed allocation, persistent pre-allocation, journal checksumming.  
<ul>
<li>Skill set: kernel and filesystem development</li>
</ul>

<a id="media" name="media"></a>
<h3>Media</h3>
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Add encoding support to our MediaKit</h4>
The current media add-on API only supports decoding media. An API for encoding has to be created that fulfills all modern requirements (ie. B-frames). Furthermore, the existing encoders should be extended to export their functionality using this API.  For a more detailed description, see : <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/3580">#3580</a>
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1043">#1043</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/3580">#3580</a></li>
<li>Skill set: You should have an interest in media encoders and should have experience in designing APIs. Knowledge of encoding algorithms is beneficial.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Generic S/PDIF support</h4>
This should be implemented with Media Kit, so as to allow any Media Kit aware application to make use of it.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: API design, general C/C++  </li>
</ul>

<a id="network" name="network"></a>
<h3>Network</h3>
<!--
<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement ICMP error handling and propagation</h4>
The current stack implementation lacks a mechanism to deliver ICMP error messages to the protocols, and also to produce ICMP error messages on behalf of the protocol implementations. ICMP error handling would need to be implemented in the IPv4, TCP, and UDP protocols.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/800">#800</a>, and possibly <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1073">#1073</a></li>
<li>Skill set: network protocols, kernel level development experience probably helps</li>
</ul>
//-->

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Integrate our PPP implementation</h4>
Port the PPP implementation to our new network stack. Add phone-line modem support, including HDLC framing and VJC compression (porting both algorithms is sufficient, but make sure the license is compatible to MIT). Implement CHAP authentication. Find and fix bugs.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/812">#812</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/869">#869</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/873">#873</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/922">#922</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/923">#923</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1059">#1059</a>, maybe: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1057">#1057</a>, <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1058">#1058</a></li>
<li>Skill set: multi-threading basics, maybe network protocols and some kernel/drivers development, maybe UI development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement ZeroConf/Bonjour support</h4>
It's sufficient to port an existing solution. Options include <a href="http://developer.apple.com/networking/bonjour/index.html">Apple's Bonjour implementation</a> or <a href="http://avahi.org/">Avahi</a>, though Apple's is probably preferred since it has a license more compatible with Haiku's MIT license.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1042">#1042</a></li>
<li>Skill set: network protocols, maybe kernel development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">WiFi support (big task)</h4>
Design a WiFi stack API, and implement it. There is lots of code to look at and/or port in FreeBSD. Also, the recently adopted WiFi stack in the Linux kernel could help with the design.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1050">#1050</a></li>
<li>Skill set: network stack development, WiFi protocols, kernel/driver development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Implement IPv6 support (big task)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Skill set: IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, kernel and network stack development</li>
</ul>



<a id="user-interface" name="user-interface"></a>
<h3>User Interface</h3>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Multi-monitor support for the app_server</h4>
The app_server needs to handle multiple monitors in its internal screen representation and configuration. The drawing call dispatching would need to be split up, so that drawing commands are dispatched to different Accelerants.<br>
To ease development, having two graphics cards in your computer is recommended, as none of the existing Haiku drivers currently support dual head output correctly (as the accelerant interface does not define a way to use it).
<ul>
<li>Skill set: graphics drivers, application design, AGG</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Hardware 3D acceleration</h4>
Design or port an existing 3D driver interface. See for example the <a href="http://www.tungstengraphics.com/wiki/index.php/Gallium3D">Gallium3D</a> project. Another option is to write a compatibility layer to load binary Linux 3D graphics drivers. There should probably still be our own 3D acceleration API for drivers.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: graphics drivers, API design</li>
</ul>

<a id="other" name="other"></a> 
<h3>Other</h3>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Create a CIFS implementation</h4>
Implement a file system add-on to be able to mount Windows network shares. File systems can be developed and debugged in <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/documents/dev/running_userlandfs">userland</a> for Haiku. Mounting shares from the command line would already be a great success, but the project could be rounded off with a "Connect to Server" type of GUI which also remembers previous connections.
<ul>
<li>Skill set: good C and POSIX knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Add BFS support to FUSE</h4>
We already have the <code>bfs_shell</code> as part of our build system that works natively on Linux, FreeBSD, and other POSIX compliant operating systems.
This could be used to make BFS accessible read/write via FUSE.
<ul>
<li>Tickets: <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/3542">#3542</a></li>
<li>Skill set: A good knowledge of C/C++, and not to be afraid of kernel level development</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="icon-app-medium">Continue the CUPS port</h4>
Developer Ithamar Adema has started a port of CUPS to integrate it with the Haiku printing kit.
