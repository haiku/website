<h2>1st Party</h2>

<h4>Updating Mail</h4>
<p>Haiku provides an innovative Mail management system using the file system database-like features (queries) to efficiently manage the e-mails. While the technology for this is working well, the user interface is rather limited, making it difficult to use the feature up to its full potential.</p>
<p>The first part of this task is reworking the code base to adhere to our coding style guidelines and convert the user interface to the Layout Kit, making it work with all font sizes and languages. The code should be improved to use proper object oriented programming concepts, and reviewed for potential thread-safety issues.</p>
<p>The second part of this task is to improve the user interface to meet today's expectations of a great way to view and edit your mail.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1431">#1431: Mail codebase needs a cleanup to fix several issues</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/5140">#5140: Mail GUI enhancements</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/5141">#5141: Generating queries for related mails in Mail</a></li>
<li>Support grouping e-mail messages by discussion thread</li>
<li>â€¦and of course you can extend this with more ideas for improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Updating and Extending WebPositive</h4>
<p>Haiku uses a WebKit based browser called WebPositive. The browser is still quite simple and can be improved in multiple ways. Some of the missing features are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing session management. Opened tabs should be remembered and restored when the program is exited and restarted.</li>
<li>Missing Cookie Jar management. There should be a way to list, delete and edit network cookies.</li>
<li>Missing management of broken HTTPS certificates. There should be a way to remember exceptions to the system-wide certificate list.</li>
<li>Support for browser extensions, such as ad-block. This could be done either reusing extensions from other browsers (if possible), or using the native add-ons system.</li>
</ul>

<h4>DiskUsage</h4>
<p>DiskUsage could be inproved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of top space using directories in pane on left.</li>
<li>Colors on fan gradually lighten but stay in same color for subfans to more easily indicate subdirectory relationships.</li>
<li>Optionally allow for sorting fans based on space usage, not just directory/alphabetical order. Or just make that the default.</li>
<li>Allow for trashing files or folders from within the app (on right click.)</li>
<li>Window to find and show duplicate files.</li>
<li>Allow for filtering based on MIME-type (how much music or images do I have, etc.)</li>
<li>Improve DiskUsage support of packagefs</li>

<h4>People</h4>
<p>The People application is our contacts manager that uses system metadata to store contact information. We need someone to modernise the application and allow it to import (or sync) contacts from online services such as Google Contacts. </p>

<h4>LaunchBox</h4>
<p>LaunchBox is the Haiku dock application. It needs to be <a href="https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/9480">updated</a> to properly display mounted disks, overlays and disk usage instead of generic folder icons.</p>

<h4>RemoteDesktop</h4>
<p>RemoteDesktop needs to be made <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org/node/6007">end user friendly</a> and given full graphical user interface to match.</p>

<h4>Crash Reporter</h4>
<p>Haiku is in need of an application that can automatically report crashes that the user wishes to share with Haiku developers. The application could make use of code from Goolge Breakpad, which is under an appropriate licence for Haiku to use.</p>

<h4>Password Manager</h4>
<p>Haiku already has the underlying technology for a password manager, however there currently is no graphical user interface for the application.</p>

<h4>Haiku SDK: Debugger</h4>
<p>Our graphical debugger is now used as default in Haiku, but there are still some areas that need improvement to match the features of graphical debuggers on other systems.</p>

<h4>Haiku SDK: Graphical Profiler/Tracer</h4>
<p>We need something like KCachegrind, AMD CodeAnalyst or Stackify for Haiku.</p>

<h4>MediaPlayer</h4>

<h4>HaikuDepot</h4>

<h2>3rd Party</h2>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/HaikuArchives/Calendar">Improve the Calendar application</a></h4>

<h4>Photo Album</h4>
<p>Update the application <a href="https://depot.haiku-os.org/album/">Album</a>Album to match the features of Google Picasa.</p>

<h4>Download Manager</h4>
<p>While BeGet and VWGet are available for Haiku, we still need a full featured Download Manager for Haiku.</p>

<h4>Softphone</h4>
<p>Update the application Whisper to match the features of soft phones on other systems.</p>

<h4>UML Modeller</h4>

<h4>Photo post-production</h4>

<h4>Presentation Creator</h4>

<h4>Screen Reader</h4>

<h2>Porting software</h2>

<h4>Migrating Haiku WebKit port to WebKit2</h4>
<p>Haiku has a native WebKit port which uses the WebKit1 API. Since this port was made, the WebKit project migrated to WebKit2, which provides several new features and separates the work in several processes to limit the impact of crashes in one or the other.
</p><p>
The goal of this task is to get WebKit2 to run on Haiku. This involves implementing the required inter-process communication primitives in WTF (first reusing the UNIX socket support used on Linux ports, then migrating to BMessages if this is relevant/useful), and writing a WebKit2-style API for WebKit, which can be used in native Haiku  applications. Proof of concepts could be a minimal browser, an update to the existing WebPositive, or adding a web view to existing applications such as Mail or fRiSS.</p>

<h4>KVM acceleration for Haiku's QEmu port</h4>
<p>QEmu is a virtual machine allowing to run an operating system inside of another. While there already is an Haiku port, it currently does not support any acceleration system through native virtualization (KVM/KQemu). This makes it too slow for many uses. Fixing this would allow Haiku user to run another system, such as Windows or Linux, when they need to run an application that is not yet available for Haiku. This would make using Haiku as their primary operating system a viable approach for more people.</p>
