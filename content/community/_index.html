<p>The Haiku community is composed of both individuals and groups of people
that assist directly or indirectly the development and promotion of Haiku.
This section is intended to give information about the Haiku community itself,
as well as other communities surrounding the Haiku project.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Besides the Haiku repository that provides the packages that make up the operating
system and HaikuPorts which offers a large number of 3rd party software, there
are several other repositories and software collections that are independently curated by
community members.</p>
<p>The Haiku project isn't legally or otherwise responsible for the contents of those sites.</p>
