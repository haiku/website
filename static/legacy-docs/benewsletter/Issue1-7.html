There's a lot of hype about the world-wide web and all the wonderful ways
it will make our lives better. Many of the promises will come true, and
many will not, but one thing is certain:
<acronym class="acronym" title="Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</acronym> is now the standard for
networking! Virtually every computer in the world has a <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> stack
written for it, and all the major players who thought they could dominate
the world with their proprietary protocols are now migrating to <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym>.
As a new computer, the BeBox will not have to suffer through any such
migration headaches. We do <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> and only <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym>. This keeps things
simple for us, and simple for you. Now that you're completely sold on
<acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym>, we can move on to discuss what we implement in terms of <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym>,
how we implement it, and what some of our future plans are.
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> has always been the network protocol of choice for UNIX systems,
and as such, there are several public-domain <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> UNIX programs
available. Almost all are in source code form (I salivate just thinking
about it). So we have made our API to networking very similar to the UNIX
standard of Berkeley sockets, so that we and others can benefit from
these programs right away. Most of these programs are command-line
oriented, and therefore completely appropriate for the "geeks" who will
be our initial customers. We have already ported ftp, ftpd, and telnet,
without many problems, and we may port a few more. Longer term, we
obviously want <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> applications that capitalize on the Be interface,
to satisfy the mere mortals who think a C shell is something you find on
the beach (rightly so I might add). Many of our third parties are indeed
developing GUI-based network applications, and I hope to see a
commercial-quality web browser and e-mail application soon.
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> is typically implemented in the kernel, and hence it robs
applications of precious memory whether you're using the network or not.
Be networking, on the other hand, is implemented almost entirely as a
server. If you aren't using it, it won't get in your way, since the
kernel will swap it out. If you are using it, there's a slight
performance penalty, due to the extra level of indirection. However,
since the PowerPC is plenty fast at copying data to and from the network
server, the net effect is negligible, at least when compared to standard
10-megabit Ethernet speeds.
</p><p>
The major disadvantage with this architecture is that it's not the way
UNIX does things, and so there are a few things to be aware of when
porting UNIX code. To UNIX applications, <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> is just another file
descriptor that you can call <code class="function">read()</code>,
<code class="function">write()</code>, and <code class="function">close()</code> on. On the
BeBox, <acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym> sockets live in a separate name space from file
descriptors, and hence you cannot use these calls. However, it's simply a
matter of using <code class="function">recv()</code>, <code class="function">send()</code>,
and <code class="function">closesocket()</code> instead.
</p><p>
Another problem arises from the fact that sockets are not inherited
across POSIX <code class="function">fork()</code> calls, as they are in UNIX. WINSOCK (Windows sockets)
has similar problems, and if any of you've ported code to WINSOCK, you've
already dealt with these issues.
</p><p>
The network server implements the following alphabet soup of protocols:
<acronym class="acronym" title="Point to Point Protocol">PPP</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Internet Protocol">IP</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Universal Datagram Protocol">UDP</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Address Resolution Protocol">ARP</acronym>, and
<acronym class="acronym" title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</acronym>.
Some of you may be familiar with all of
these already, but I'll guess that many are not, so I 'll briefly
describe each of them. <acronym class="acronym">PPP</acronym> stands for Point-to-Point Protocol and is the
Internet standard for doing networking over a serial connection. If you
use a modem or <acronym class="acronym" title="Integrated Services Digital Network">ISDN</acronym>
to access the Internet, most likely you're using <acronym class="acronym">PPP</acronym>.
<acronym class="acronym" title="Serial Line Interface Protocol">SLIP</acronym>,
which we don't implement, is an older, nonstandard protocol that
performs a similar function. <acronym class="acronym">PPP</acronym> knows nothing about higher-level
protocols, and so it's able to deliver any protocol, such as
<acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Internetwork Packet eXchange">IPX</acronym>, or
AppleTalk. We only use it for <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym>.
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> stands for Internet Protocol. It's responsible for delivering packets
from one computer to another, regardless of where they are in the world.
<acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> packets may be routed through several computers before reaching their
final destination. Applications almost never use <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> directly, but instead
use either <acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym> or <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym>, which is layered on top of it.
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym> stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It can deliver data between
any two applications in the world. <acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym> is a reliable protocol, meaning
that it will either deliver the data you give it to the remote
application in sequence without any duplication, or it will notify you
that the connection is broken and it can no longer do its job. <acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym> cannot
be broadcast to a local area network. Examples of common <acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym> applications
are <acronym class="acronym" title="HyperText Transport Protocol">HTTP</acronym>
(the world-wide web protocol), telnet and ftp.
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym> stands for User Datagram Protocol, although most people mistakenly
believe it stands for Unreliable Datagram Protocol. <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym>, like <acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym>, can
deliver data between any two applications in the world. <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym> can also
broadcast data to a local network, so that several applications can get
the data at once. <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym> is a lightweight protocol, meaning that it's almost
always faster than <acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym>. The big drawback of <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym> is that it makes no
attempts to deliver data reliably, and sometimes its packets get lost
(hence the misnomer). Still, it's possible to build reliable applications
around <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym>, but the application must do its own acknowledgments to ensure
the packets do indeed arrive at their destination. Examples of common <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym>
applications are the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Network File System
(NFS).
</p><p>
The remaining protocols are <acronym class="acronym">ARP</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">ICMP</acronym>, neither of which is very useful
to applications. When <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> is layered on top of Ethernet, <acronym class="acronym">ARP</acronym> (Address
Resolution Protocol) is used to automatically find the physical Ethernet
destination associated with a given logical IP destination. <acronym class="acronym">ICMP</acronym>
(Internet Control Message Protocol) is used for various <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> diagnostic
functions. It's most famous for its use in the ping program for
rudimentary network diagnostics.
</p><p>
The network server does not implement the Ethernet driver or the serial
driver. Instead, it opens these drivers in the kernel by name. Hence, the
network server can be targeted to run over any Ethernet card or serial
device, as long as there is a driver available for it. Our Ethernet
driver works with any NE2000 compatible <acronym class="acronym">ISA</acronym> card and the 3COM 3C503 card.
Many decent NE2000 <acronym class="acronym">ISA</acronym> cards are available today at low prices, handling
<acronym class="acronym" title="Bayonet-Neill-Concelman">BNC</acronym>, twisted-pair, or
<acronym class="acronym" title="Attachment Unit Interface">AUI</acronym> media. The drivers are dynamically loaded into
the Be kernel, and third-parties (or Be) should be able to deliver
drivers for other network media without changing any source in our kernel.
</p><p>
OK, so that's what we implement. We have the basics of <acronym class="acronym"><acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym></acronym>, enough to
implement many significant applications using <acronym class="acronym">TCP</acronym> or <acronym class="acronym">UDP</acronym>. However, we
still have much to do. There's a long list I'll go into, but keep in mind
that none of these are commitments, merely wishes, so please don't go and
bet your company on any of these! One area of future work is performance.
While our performance is pretty good, comparable to a Macintosh and some
UNIX systems, we would still like to approach speeds seen in the FreeBSD
and Linux UNIX systems. <acronym class="acronym">PPP</acronym> is still in its infancy, and there's much
work to do there to make it easy to use and as robust as possible.
</p><p>
Also, we want our network configuration application to make simple things
simple, while allowing you to do more complex things, such as configuring
Ethernet cards or multiple <acronym class="acronym">IP</acronym> addresses. Further into the future, we
would like to support <acronym class="acronym">NFS</acronym> (Network File System) for file sharing, <acronym class="acronym">DHCP</acronym>
(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) so that you don't have to configure
IP addresses, Multilink <acronym class="acronym">PPP</acronym> for
utilizing both "B" channels of an <acronym class="acronym">ISDN</acronym>
card (perhaps a third-party opportunity), and Internet Multicast to
support applications like <acronym class="acronym">MBONE</acronym>. We also would like to develop some
Be-specific protocols, so that Be applications can be easily extended to
the network. A simple way to do this is to extend the Be Messenger class,
so that it could be instantiated targeting either a local or a remote
application. Applications on your desktop could easily take advantage of
services not otherwise available locally, such as faster
<acronym class="acronym" title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</acronym> speeds,
distributed processing, heavyweight database services, or exotic I/O
devices.
</p><p>
As you can see, there's a lot to do. We're not a big company with a large
army of programmers devoted to <acronym class="acronym"><acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym></acronym>. Nope, we're just a little company,
with a single programmer (me) at the helm of <acronym class="acronym"><acronym class="acronym">TCP/IP</acronym></acronym>. The good news is
that your feedback is certain to get to the right person, loud and clear.
We, of course, welcome any feedback you may have.

Several Be developers and posters on comp.sys.be have asked me to discuss
our strategy. I'd like to begin by returning to the dictionary. It
defines strategy as "The science and art of military command exercised to
meet the enemy in combat under advantageous conditions."
</p><p>
The word strategy is often used to aggrandize and embellish statements of
little importance. Why call a move "tactical" when I can charge the
client, or the boss, strategic rates for my foils or my press releases?
Abused or not, there's a lot to like in the definition of strategy, of
creating "advantageous conditions" by which we fight for a place under
the sun. This is what I will discuss today. Mark Gonzales, our marketing
sage, will review market-by-market specifics in future columns.
</p><p>
Let's start with what we call our architectural advantage. We say we
offer an alternative to legacy systems by offering a baggage-free
architecture. The pluses and minuses are well understood. On the minus
side, we forfeit a legacy of thousands of applications. They run on older
platforms and we start with an installed base of zero. On the plus side,
a fresh start frees us from the baggage of a decade or more of
incremental fixes and extensions, from many accumulated layers of
software silt. As a result, we offer features hard or impossible to graft
onto legacy platforms: Multiprocessing, multithreading, an integrated
database engine, preemptive multitasking, media kits, richer and geekier
I/O, a simpler cleaner programming model... The enumeration is a little
dry on paper but a demonstration makes it come to life—an experience
we enjoyed on a large scale at MacWorld. All right, but what's strategic
here? If, in a short period of time, our noble and worthy elders could
replicate the advantages we offer, we'd be in a position known as picking
up dimes one foot ahead of the steamroller. On the contrary, most
observers agree our key features are hard, if not impossible to graft
onto a legacy platform in a threateningly short amount of time. After
all, our best-managed elder still needed five years to polish its latest
major revision, and the one to which we are more sentimentally attached
will need six, some say seven years for a similar step. So, we have a
lasting technical lead, which in turn creates a set of "advantageous
conditions " for us to go to the marketplace. This is the first element
of our strategy. Of course, we need to be aware of two dangers. First,
once we start to appear on their radar screens, our colleagues will use
the age-old rhetoric: This is nothing, and if you still need it, we've
been working on it for six years and we'll have it in six months. These
are photodegradable statements. The second, bigger danger is complacency,
standing still. I think we're all aware enough of our surroundings to
recognize the danger—but the proof is ours to produce.
</p><p>
Let's turn to the second part of our strategy. The fights we're willing
to pick, and the ones we avoid. Clearly, in the office automation market,
the game is over. Microsoft won. IBM might disagree, they have Notes,
but, with all due respect to Lou Gerstner, they don't have Bill Gates,
his management team, and his control over the Windows platform. In the
office market, Microsoft Office has become the real operating system. If
you tithe at the Office, Bill will even let you use a Macintosh, a
platform he loves to use as a way to dislodge his less bicultural
competition, such as Notes or Novell. Whatever we think of the state of
classical office productivity applications, this is not a good terrain
for us. Fortunately, there are many places where compatibility with
reigning spreadsheets, word processors, and presentation packages doesn't
matter. The BeBox, with its fast hardware and multithreading services,
makes a nice web server and it works well in image processing, digital
audio, and digital video applications. None of these areas are yet
dominated by a big predator crowding the ecological niche—especially
if we enter these segments at the personal level, as opposed to the
departmental and professional segments. This is how the Macintosh entered
the electronic publishing market. The pros initially dismissed the
Macintosh as a toy, but with the help of Adobe, Aldus, and Canon, the Mac
created a the personal publishing industry. For attentive readers of
earlier issues, I appear to contradict myself. I wrote: "Based on my
reading of the history of our industry, I believe the people involved in
building the platform, because of their close involvement, develop myopia
and can't see the tractor apps in the distance." And I referred to our
need for "guide geeks" to show us the way. Since then, we've reviewed the
questionnaires e-mailed by developers who expressed interest in writing
applications on the BeBox. We've now received over 900 such
questionnaires, which is not a claim we enjoy over 900 active developers,
yet. We expect to pass the milestone of 250 BeBoxes actually and actively
in developers hands some time in February. Returning to these
questionnaires, they paint the picture of an enthusiastic, creative, and
experienced community. The four domains outlined above are the areas
where we see the most stated interest, but not all, by far. This gives us
plenty of room to gather strength, to create alliances with like-minded
people and companies, and to innovate and flourish in emerging
applications, on the value-creating side of the web and digital media. By
"value-creating side," I mean those who create, edit, produce, and
broadcast these new media, as opposed to the consuming side—a totally
different game.
</p><p>
By carefully picking the technical and market terrains, we intend to
create the conditions under which this product and this company, still in
their infancy, can grow to achieve their full potential.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-7"></a>Be Developer Profile: Adobe Systems Incorporated</h2></div></div></div><p>
To be sure, many BeBox developers are small, one- or two-person software
houses—but not all of them.
</p><p>
Adobe Systems Incorporated, the desktop publishing behemoth in Mountain
View, California, has assigned three engineers to look at porting its
industry-leading Photoshop application to the BeBox.
</p><p>
Now, one might think that a company the size of Adobe might not consider
a market as small as Be's current installed base. But according to Sean
Parent, Adobe's Macintosh technical leader, there are some compelling
reasons to do so. The BeBox offers Adobe the opportunity to have a
low-cost, high-performance platform for Photoshop. The company
understands the potential of multiprocessing architectures, and there is
no other platform with the price/performance ratio offered by the BeBox.
</p><p>
Parent notes that the Macintosh by itself doesn't support
multiprocessing. People who want these capabilities on the Mac have to
buy a Daystar Genesis add-on card for as much as $1,400. The other
high-performance, multiprocessing platforms are either Windows NT or UNIX
systems, both of which are priced significantly higher than the BeBox.
</p><p>
Additionally, Adobe currently supports all of the major platforms, so it
makes sense for the company to support a significant emerging platform
for desktop publishing and other graphics-intensive applications.
</p><p>
On the technical side, Parent said Adobe has "sucked all of the
performance out of the Mac file system that it is going to offer." Be is
offering a high-performance platform with an improved file system, which
can better exploit planned enhancements to Photoshop.
</p><p>
It won't be difficult to port Photoshop to the BeBox. The PowerPC version
of Photoshop is already written using Metrowerks CodeWarrior, the same
development environment that's used to write applications for the BeBox.
And the program is written to be easily ported from one platform to
another.
</p><p>
So far, Adobe hasn't decided whether it will bring Photoshop for the
BeBox to market. But the company is interested enough to devote some of
its engineering resources to the platform to see what's possible. Once
Parent and his team come up with a workable Photoshop version for the
BeBox, Adobe will make a final decision about which way to go.
