A developer release is like a family photo taken on the last day of a
week-long Italian wedding party. The photographer shouts "Dite
formaggio," and, reflexively, the grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins,
esposi y monelli look up for the flash to capture an accumulated forced
smile. That little moment passed, they return to the arguments and the
serious drinking.
</p><p>
Of course, there's always somebody missing from the picture. Our
prodigal, in developer release 7, is the fortune cookie, the verbum
nerdum that you (used to) get with each shell. Fortune cookies are easy
to despise: They're rarely worth reading, and the concept is
embarrassingly geeky. But after indulging in this initial, priggish
scoff, I settled into a patronizing tolerance, from which middle road it
was an easy slide into guilty anticipation.
</p><p>
The fortune cookie phenomenon used to be the domain of UNIX-grade
systems. But there's an equivalent in PC-land: Microsoft Word's Tip of
the Day. My introduction to Word came when I offered to help format a
newsletter at my daughters' school. Although I'd never used Word before,
I figured it was probably similar to Frame, which I knew all too well.
The newsletter document was already open when I sat down to fiddle with
the heading styles; within a few keystrokes and mouse-clicks, the machine
froze. I thought this was serious. Not only was I unfamiliar with Word,
I'd never really used a PC before—I had yet to understand that
crashing is a proof of existence.
</p><p>
Acting quickly, I power-cycled the machine, logged in using my friend's
name, guessed at the password (right the second time), found the Word
icon, and restarted the program. Up popped a little box that said
something like:
</p><p>
"Did you know ... If you applied built-in heading styles
to headings, you can create cross-references...."
</p><p>
and so on. I realize now that it was just coincidence, but at the time I
thought the program was actually trying to tell me what I had done wrong
—after all, I had been playing with heading styles when the machine
crashed, and here it was recommending... My God... Was Microsoft actually
bundling a laudable form of artificial intelligence? Was I going to have
to recant my snobbish dismissal of these toy computers? On the verge of
apostasy, I tried to banish the knife before me—I quit Word and
relaunched. Another little box:
</p><p>
"Did you know ... If you use fewer words, your documents
will be shorter?"
</p><p>
Somewhere in the back of my pea brain a night light glimmered. I quit and
launched again:
</p><p>
"Did you know ... You can check grammar in a document?"
</p><p>
I got it.
</p><p>
(Years later, I concatenated a couple of Word's tips:
</p><p>
"You can check grammar in a document. Word can analyze
the readability of a document."
</p><p>
and ran them through the program's grammar checker. They scored an
appalling 52.58 out of 100. (By the tool's own estimation, an average
document should score between 60 and 70.)
</p><p>
The Be fortune cookies are—excuse me, were—distinctly more amusing
and less annoying than Word's Tip of the Day. For me, one cookie in
particular stood out from the batch:
</p><p>
"When confronted by a difficult problem, you can solve it
more easily by reducing it to the question: `How would
the Lone Ranger have handled this?'"
</p><p>
Admittedly, this isn't one of the shell's wittier offerings. Until
recently, I would have dismissed it as an easy and uninspired cliche. But
that was before my awakening.
</p><p>
Some months ago I was driving peacefully, dreaming along a pleasant
boulevard, when my reverie was shattered by the frothing bark of an angry
young white male, muscle-bound at 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. There, in
the left turn lane, was the evidence of a minor collision between Mr.
Tank Top's American pickup (in front), and a teeny foreign sub-compact
driven by my mother (speaking figuratively). The two drivers were freshly
out of their vehicles in preparation for what is, normally, a graceful
insurance card gavotte—but here, instead, we had a red-faced goon,
fists raised, screaming obscenities at my cowering mom.
</p><p>
Understand that I was driving in lightly heavy traffic two lanes to the
right. The scene pressed itself into my awareness in an instant: A
defenseless woman in obvious need of a champion. An instant more, and the
moment for action would be lost. I wasn't obliged to stop; none of this
was my doing; aside from her being my mother, I'd never seen the woman
before. It's at times like this, when the present becomes remarkably
immediate, that we show who it is we really think it is we are. So,
what's the first thing that pops into my head as naturally as instinct?
</p><p>
"What would Sean Connery do?"
</p><p>
Literally. I have two smallish children and one large mortgage at home; I
have advanced degrees in music from major universities; I hitchhiked
across East Germany before the wall came down; I don't watch much
television. Yet, when spontaneous action is necessary, I find that my
personal standard for adult behavior is measured against James Bond.
</p><p>
Dazed by my superficiality in the face of an imperative, I reviewed my
life: When I was a kid, my favorite uncle was a bachelor who owned a
small English sports car. As a teenager, my best friend (also a bachelor)
had a small English sports car. The first car I bought when I arrived in
California—while still unmarried—was a small English sports car. It
began to make sense.
</p><p>
When I got back to Be, I thought I'd retreat from my sickness by firing
up a shell and, oh, I don't know, maybe reel off a few psloop's. That's
when the Lone Ranger quote popped up. A few days later, the fortune
cookies were gone. My mother gets out of the hospital next week.
</p><p>
(According to Word's grammar checker, this document was written at a
seventh-grade level.)

Ltd.</h2></div></div></div><p>
According to a recent newspaper article, the average number of digital
shots in special effects movies this summer will exceed 500. That's up
from 400 shots in the movie "Caspar" in the summer of 1995, and a mere 55
in the 1993 blockbuster "Jurassic Park."
</p><p>
Demand for digital video and special effects software is growing fast.
Visual effects that used to require expensive, high-end workstations can
now be achieved on low-cost personal computers, and in much less time.
</p><p>
Daniel Koch, a director at Make It So Pty. Ltd., isn't complaining. Make
It So, a Be developer based in Crows Nest, Sydney, Australia (the
Australian equivalent of Hollywood), makes special effects software for
film and video, assisting in all post-production aspects from processing,
to editing, to compositing. Make It So's current products include Digital
Fusion, which was used in several movies including "Sirens," as well as
in corporate videos, movie trailers, and a number of television ads.
(Digital Fusion is available now for MS-DOS; a port to Windows NT is in
process.)
</p><p>
With the BeBox, it was a case of instant attraction. “<span class="quote">It's got
multiprocessing, a cool API, a good OS, and lots of I/O,</span>” says Daniel.
“<span class="quote">All that at a low price, and not dominated by Microsoft. Hooray!</span>” Daniel
is especially excited about symmetric multiprocessing at a decent price.
“<span class="quote">My application requires lots of MIPS, smooth multitasking, and a rich
graphics capability. The Media Kit could be a tremendous asset. The
multiprocessors definitely will be.</span>”
</p><p>
First-hand experience with a BeBox in-house has been positive. “<span class="quote">I was
spoiled by the speed of the interface on my old Amiga—it's very hard
to work with NT as a result. The BeBox is better still, and I think I'm
going to love the quad-604,</span>” Daniel says. “<span class="quote">The best part, though, is the
uncluttered API. Drag and drop was never a lot of fun on the Amiga, and
on NT it's a Nightmare. The Be OS does it the way it should be done --
very, very easily.</span>”
</p><p>
What about the BeBox business proposition? “<span class="quote">We don't plan on making a
profit on the BeBox just yet. That will come later, when the BeBox takes
off as a powerful, low-cost film/video post-production machine. That's
why we're interested now: Having a solid offering early on in a new
platform's life could prove to be very lucrative down the road.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I'd like to see the BeBox achieve a respected position in niche markets,
particularly (and selfishly) in the video market,</span>” Daniel says. “<span class="quote">Ideally,
the machine will take over where the Amiga left off, before Wintel
machines have a chance to get a stranglehold.</span>”
</p><p>
Currently, Make It So is developing freeware utilities and drivers for
the BeBox; their projects include a simple Font Manager and a driver for
the Perception PVR video record/playback card. After they become more
familiar with the system, they plan to rewrite Digital Fusion for the
BeBox, with an anticipated availability in 6 to 12 months.
</p><p>
Summing up, Daniel says, “<span class="quote">The BeBox is a clean new machine, with a rich
feature set, for a reasonable price. It's far better than Windows
(including NT), and has much brighter prospects than Apple and Amiga.
Aside from that, it's an intriguing machine in its own right.</span>”

DR7 (our latest developer release) leaves me with mixed feelings. Not
that I'm unhappy with it, on the contrary. It's just that it reminds me
of the Sysiphean task of building system software: There's always so much
more to do.
</p><p>
But let's focus on what DR7 accomplishes, for a moment. A little over
three months after DR6 shipped, DR7 shows the most significant amount of
progress between releases—so far. (Please refer to http://www.be.com
for details, the list is too long for this column.) I'll skip quickly
over bug and feature fixes. Fixing annoying bugs in a serial driver or
allowing support of bigger than 540 MB IDE drives is good hygiene. It's
only revealing when you don't practice it.
</p><p>
One of the harder things in our business is arbitrating between the urge
to move forward, adding features, and the nagging feeling that something
needs to be rethought, and perhaps redone. The need to ship and the need
to do it "right." Put another way, it is exceedingly rare, or foolish, to
think a piece of software is absolutely right. Some features are either
good or amenable to a straightforward fix. For some others, we have to go
back and rebuild in order to avoid unfixable problems later, or missed
opportunities.
</p><p>
The file system changes fall in that category. Not surprisingly, we liked
the idea of a dual-fork system as found on the Macintosh: It offers nicer
creature comforts. What we found out, however, was it made it difficult
to coexist with other file systems. In order to better interoperate with
UNIX and Windows systems, we're going back to a single-fork file system
and, in future releases, we'll improve the integration and performance of
the combined file system and database engine. I fully expect we'll have
other such painful but healthy "opportunities" as we move forward;
they'll make a difference to our long-term success. A number of changes
in the user interface were the result of comments we received on
comp.sys.be. Very early, we got vigorous feedback for our passe scroll
bars. Nobody, but nobody wants to be seen with nonproportional scroll
bars these days. So there: Customizable scroll bars and arrows to suit
(almost) every taste. One of the most conservative members of the
technical team finally blessed them as more convenient "because they're
larger." De gustibus... The more serious point with improvements such as
a better architecture for drivers, 32-bit color, multiple IP support, and
many others is we're "excited," sort of, when someone takes the time to
criticize our work. Especially if it hurts, because it usually means the
gentle reviewer is striking a nerve, a painful pointer to an opportunity.
</p><p>
As DR7 exposes a larger area of our work, there will be no dearth of new
darts. We also added features that were not quite in the grand plan for
the Be OS. The Posix layer is one example. From the very beginning of Be
we made extensive use of UNIX tools and utilities. Programmers know them,
some even love them, many are freeware floating on the net, why re-invent
the wheel when the value we add is under and above the level at which
these tools operate? As stated before, this doesn't mean we're in the
workstation business. We just want to ease the migration path to the
BeBox for some tools and applications relevant to our business. Multiple
workspaces represent another idea that occurred to us as we compared the
workings of some UNIX desktops and of Windows and Mac systems. Our
implementation of workspaces picked up on the idea of grouping
applications and documents by affinity and switching between contexts
with a mouse click, or a keystroke. We added a few twists, such as
switching screen depth and resolution on the fly when moving from one
workspace to another, and using drag-and-drop moves on a miniature
representation of the workspaces. It's not the most important improvement
we've made, but it is one of the more immediately pleasing to those of us
who have cluttered desktops. If you check our web site you'll be invited
to test-drive the development environment. This points to perhaps the
most important improvement: CodeWarrior DR 1 is now available on the
BeBox. It's the native version of Metrowerks' award-winning IDE.
CodeWarrior DR1 makes writing code for the BeBox a more pleasant, faster,
and less expensive experience as the user interface improves dramatically
and the need for other hardware—such as a Mac or a UNIX system --
diminishes or vanishes altogether.
</p><p>
In an earlier column, I made the point we were in the early phase of the
life of this platform. As a result, we were in a period of increasing
returns while older systems were showing signs of slowing down.
Hopefully, DR7 buttresses this contention. And I'll hasten to say we're
painfully aware of the task ahead of us. We know the feedback we'll
receive from DR7 users, old and new, will keep us as focused and grateful
as we are today.
