By now you're probably starting to absorb the long list of things that
have changed for DR9. Among these changes are a new Tracker and a new
tracker shared library, which, among other things, contains the
implementation for the "Open" and "Save" panels. This might not seem like
a big deal but it does represent a significant step forward in the
ability to customize and use the file panel. This article will describe,
generally, how customization of the file panels can be done. The coming
DR9 documentation will include full details for using the <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code>
object.
</p><p>
In DR8, an application invoked the file panel by sending a "display file
panel" message to the Browser. There was a problem with this design: The
file panel was actually running inside the Browser's address space. This
put significant constraints on your ability to custom the file panel
since you didn't have direct access to the file panel window containing
the file panel.
</p><p>
In DR9, the file panel implementation is part of a shared library that
your applications can link with. When a <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> object is
instantiated, it creates a regular window in the caller's address space.
A pointer to the window is accessible through a method of the BFilePanel
object. With this change, you have full access to the window which is
displaying the file panel and can add and remove views, change the window
title, and resize things according to your needs.
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> object in DR9 has some customizability built right into
the class. As examples, the constructor lets you specify...
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
the 'what' of the notification message that's generated by the file
panel,
</p></li><li><p>
the target of the message,
</p></li><li><p>
the directory that the panel will initially display,
</p></li><li><p>
a filter object (<code class="classname">BRefFilter</code>) that displays only certain items from
the directory,
</p></li><li><p>
whether the user can select multiple items at once,
</p></li></ul><p>
and so on.
</p><p>
There are, however, other ways in which developers might want to add
application-specific functionality to the file panel. Some examples would
be a custom menu that lets the user select the type or format of files
that show up in the open panel, or maybe a mini-page view of the selected
item in the file panel.
</p><p>
Let's look at the add-a-custom-menu example:
</p><p>
The first thing you do is get the window object itself by invoking
<code class="methodname">Window()</code> on your <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code>.
You then get the background view by asking
for child 0, and add your menu to that view—the panel is yours, you
can do what you want. (Note that by the time the real DR9 is released,
we'll put names on all the views in the panel, so you can get the
background view through the friendlier <code class="methodname">FindView()</code> function.)
</p><p>
Your menu can include items that allow the user to specify the types or
sets of files that are displayed in the file panel. Each menu item can be
targeted to the object that's controlling your <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code>, such as a
document window or your application object. When the messages generated
by the menu items are received you can use some other methods of
<code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> to change the displayed items in the file panel. To do this
you would find two methods particularly useful:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The first is <code class="methodname">SetRefFilter()</code>. This method lets you specify a new
filter through which all items are sent before being displayed in the
file panel. The "RefFilter" can then determine which items it wants to
let through and which to filter out. To get the file panel to
re-display its contents you simply call the <code class="methodname">Refresh()</code> method of
<code class="classname">BFilePanel</code>. This forces the currently-displayed directory to run its
entire contents back through the filter and display only specific items.
</p></li><li><p>
Another way to accomplish the same thing would be to create your own
<code class="classname">BRefFilter</code> subclass, and keep a pointer to
the <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> object or
your menu. Then, instead of changing the ref filter when the user
selects a menu item, you would simply call <code class="methodname">Refresh()</code> and the
<code class="varname">RefFilter</code> object itself would look at the currently selected menu item
and could filter items based on this.
</p></li></ul><p>
The other customization example described above can be accomplished using
some other methods of the <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> class. To add a selection-sensitive
mini page view you would probably want to create the file panel in
"single-selection" mode, thereby limiting the user to selecting one item
at a time. You can then add your custom mini-page view to the file panel
window using the technique described above. To get notified about changes
to the selection, you would create a subclass of <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> and override
the <code class="methodname">SelectionChanged()</code> method. This method is called each time the user
has clicked in the file panel window and possibly changed the selected
item. Using the <code class="methodname">Rewind()</code> and
<code class="methodname">GetNextRef()</code> methods of <code class="classname">BFilePanel</code> you
can then iterate through the currently selected items in the file panel
and generate a mini page view for the selected item.
</p><p>
These are just some of the ways in which you can customize the new DR9
file panel. With the ability to access the file panel window in your
applications own address space, you can now use the full power of the Be
Kits to customize the file panel according to your needs.

Oh boy what a week! First our own Developers' Conference, and then the
Apple World Wide Developers Conference. It was all a bit daunting, but we
made it through.
</p><p>
At the Apple WWDC I had the chance to mingle with some of my old NeXT
programming buddies. I got into NeXT programming in 1989/90. That's about
7 years ago. At the time, it was hot, exciting, and the programmers were
full of a fire to change the world. I ran across one of these programmers
and mentioned I was at Be now (I was wearing a Be T-shirt) and that he
should consider jumping ship and joining the new rebellion. His response
was that he didn't have another leap in him, and it was Rhapsody, or Java
(said with a cringe).
</p><p>
Well, this just goes to show that times do change. As professional
programmers, we sometimes go with what's new and exciting, and sometimes
with what's tried and true. To recover from the long week of conferences,
I was lying on the floor in my family room doing situps. Of course Yasmin
had to come over and sit on my chest to help the effort. As I was
struggling to do those 20 situps, with 28 pounds of wiggling fury on my
chest, I couldn't help but consider the parallel between this situation
and trying to program in some heavy duty operating systems. Once again
I'm grateful that I am programming in the BeOS.
</p><p>
And so, you have DR9 in your hands. Let me point out a few things. The CD
contains some sample code. In the optional directory, you should find GNU
sources as well as several sample applications. These should help you out
while we continue to produce documentation. Also, these samples will be
available at:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples
</p><p>
Keep a watchful eye here for continued releases of many sample
applications. To make good on promises made at the Dev Con, I've put up
the VideoCenter application. For those of you who attended the Video on
Be session, this is the FireWire/TVTuner demo application. BeTV by Kevin
Hendrickson was a clear winner in our Master's program. The VideoCenter
application is not his, but our own sample app to help you work the same
magic that he does.
</p><p>
For those of you frantically sending mail to Developer Support, with no
response this past week, we're back in the saddle again. Of course your
patience is greatly appreciated, and you'll be rewarded with
documentation, sample apps, and helpful answers to your questions.
</p><p>
Of course by now you've already ported your applications and you have
absolutely no problems because the Advanced Access release is the best
thing since sliced bread...
</p><p>
Well, at least you're not trying to do situps with dead weight on your
chest.

Criticizing Microsoft is a popular and politically correct pastime. Even
iftheir actions were totally simon-pure, their size and success would
still attract the inevitable jealousy and fear. That's what generating
$400 million of cash per month does for you.
</p><p>
The old fear Microsoft would abuse its OS platform position to gain an
unfair advantage has been given new energy by the Web battle royale
between Netscape and Microsoft. The early, almost forgotten,
anti-Microsoft argument was: "In the future the OS won't matter." Using a
combination of Java and HTML, the browser's destiny was to become the
universal platform on which to build the applications of the future.
</p><p>
There was, and still is, some truth in the gospel. HTML and the browser
emerged as wonderful Intranet tools, finally delivering a set of unified
building blocks for client-server applications delivering up-to-date,
rich information on corporate desks. Microsoft, in effect, said: "Wait a
minute, if the browser is so fundamental, we'll make it part of the OS,
of the platform, thank you."
</p><p>
As they are doing just that, fear and accusations mount that Microsoft
unfairly uses its OS position to dictate the browsing standard. After
all, Windows commands about 95% of desktops, your Web page better be
readable from those. Similar apprehension and charges float around Java,
Microsoft is accused of muscling its way into a controlling position, and
servers where Microsoft owns the increasingly successful Windows NT on
which a growing number of servers run—uncomfortably.
</p><p>
We had the oil robber barons, the Glass-Steagall Act for banks, and the
little misunderstandings involving AT&amp;T or IBM. When a player, or group
of players, threatened to exert too much control over a sector of the
economy, we, the people, through our selfless representatives, stepped
in. We amended the rules and made sure no little guy would be denied his
right to fair competition. It was easy to tell AT&amp;T they couldn't sell
local service anymore, or equipment. Or, as in the famous Carterphone
decision: "You can sell network services but you cannot force people to
use your telephonesets".
</p><p>
Why don't we get similar legislation or court rulings for Microsoft, then?
Because the law is impotent. You can tell a telephone from the network,
but it's hard to write an algorithm, a law, drawing an enforceable
distinction between the system and an application. Here, common sense
doesn't apply. The browser is a good example. If it is truly universal,
it needs to be there all the time, so why not make it part of the system.
How do you tell an application from the system?
</p><p>
Tomorrow, Microsoft could decide to bundle, sorry, integrate, parts of
Microsoft Office into Windows 5.0 and sell the rest separately, or as an
upgrade to the system, as they did shortly with Plus! They place their
browser on the Windows desktop as The Internet (one wonders when they'll
call that on the Mac desktop as well), that's either cheeky or telling,
but they have the right to do so and, and, again, it's hard to see an
enforceable law against it. The same applies to the integration/bundling
of server software on Windows NT.
</p><p>
There is a double irony here. First, the lack of algorithm against the
devouring algorithm Windows has become, the lack of legally enforceable
categories that would help limit the cancerous growth.
</p><p>
Secondly, it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between
the role played by Microsoft's superb management and hard work, and the
increasingly questioned impact of their size and of their irrepressible
appetites. It is hard to imagine a company as driven, as competitive as
Microsoft suddenly exercising self-restraint, especially when goaded by
the likes or Sun, Oracle and Netscape, and their barbed leaders.
</p><p>
So, in the absence of either unthinkable self-restraint or unthinkable
laws, what do we do?

"Depth still follows focus in DR9." And with these words the UI battle
commenced. Should the active window always be frontmost?
</p><p>
Although the subject line curse was prompted by the inflexibility of
window focus, some folks think that forcing the active window to the
front is the most intuitive design and the simplest, least confusing
presentation, particularly for new users. But, as Marco Nelissen asked,
"should the whole UI be crippled just to accomodate new users?"
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id563259"></a>Subject: Attributes and pathnames</h4></div></div></div><p>
Many developers are dismayed that with the demise of record_refs so
went persistent file IDs. Pathnames are fine for identifying a
location, but is there any way to persistently tag the inode portion of
a file?
</p><p>
A number of solutions were suggested and debated, including using
attributes, a "file id" server, maintaining the Be B-tree on each
mounted volume, and so on. However, none of the suggestions was
universally applicable to all (potentially) plugged-in file systems.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id563282"></a>Subject: 128MB in DR9?</h4></div></div></div><p>
How much swap space is enough? Now that VM is configurable and has its
own preferences panel, should you stick with the default or go for
broke? One listener suggested pushing up the swap area to about 250MB,
which suggestion blew some valves in certain foreign lands: Isn't that
a lot of swap space, particularly if you've only got a 500MB disk?
</p><p>
Then again, as Jon Watte, observed, “<span class="quote">You buy a computer for something
like $2,000, and only spend $50 on your hard disk? Where's the logic? 3
GB drives are quite affordable these days.</span>”
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id563309"></a>Subject: missing mail</h4></div></div></div><p>
BeMail isn't part of the AA-DR9 CD. In the meantime, listeners traded
ideas about mail utilities: Since mail messages are file-based, is it
(now) possible to design good command-line tools that can co-exist with
a GUI mail program? There was also talk of an IMAP (Internet Message
Access Protocol) system that would support access to remotely-stored
messages.
</p><p>
This raised the issue of canonical URL encoding—URLs aren't JUST for
mail messages in an IMAP. Should developers settle on a general
convention for how and where URLs are encoded?
