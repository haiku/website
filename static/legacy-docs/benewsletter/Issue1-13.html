efficient sharing of data. I definitely won't claim that the Be OS has
the end-all, be-all IPC, or that we've completely flushed out all the
issues related to moving data around our system. However, I do believe we
have a good
start: The Be OS provides many useful data-sharing facilities you can use
to write really exciting applications.</p><p>At the lowest level, the kernel provides three data-sharing facilities:
Thread messages, areas, and ports.</p><p>Thread messages use the simple API of
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/TheKernelKit_ThreadsAndTeams.html#receive_data"><code class="function">send_data</code></a>
and
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/TheKernelKit_ThreadsAndTeams.html#send_data"><code class="function">receive_data</code></a>.
This is perhaps the most basic messaging mechanism in the system. These messages
aren't buffered, so a call to send_data will block until it's read by the
target thread. This mechanism is used in several places in the system,
including the initial bootstrapping of applications with the app_server.
When an application launches, it uses send_data to send a message to the
app_server's 'picasso' thread. This message contains the IDs of a couple
of ports; further messaging between the application and the app_server
will use these ports.</p><p>You can use the kernel's second data-sharing facility, area, to create
new valid regions in the virtual address space. The kernel allows the
same area to be mapped into the address space of different teams
(processes). One team can create the area and pass the area_id to other
interested teams. These
teams can then map that area into their address space. This allows
applications to share memory. The
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BMessage.html"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
class, discussed below, relies on this facility.</p><p>It's worth mentioning a couple of caveats about using shared memory. If
you plan to share pointers, make sure that all the pointers point within
the shared area, and that all teams map the area into the same virtual
addresses. Otherwise one team's pointer may be another team's data
exception! Another issue is synchronizing access to the area. You can use
a semaphore to ensure that memory is only accessed when in a consistent
state. Semaphores are a system-wide resource and
the IDs are valid across all teams.</p><p>The third kernel facility that supports messaging is the port mechanism.
Ports provide a system-wide buffered messaging system. These messages can
be of arbitrary size. Anyone with a port_id can read from or write to the
port. When you create a port, you specify the number of messages that the
port can hold. If the port fills, the next call to write_port will block.
At first glance this might seem undesirable, as code cannot assume that
write_port won't block. We chose this
design to prevent an orphaned port (a port that never gets read) from
consuming all of system memory. Those buffered messages have to be stored
somewhere—the system wouldn't
be too happy buffering 1,493,467 1 K messages or around 1,500 MB of data.
The <code class="classname">BMessage</code> class, along with
<code class="classname">BMessenger</code> and <code class="classname">BLooper</code>, make use of ports
to pass messages between teams. When using ports, take care to
synchronize the writing and reading of messages. If the 'virtual' message
spans multiple calls to write_port, you must take steps to correctly deal
with other threads that might be writing to the same port. Similar issues
arise if multiple threads read from the same port.</p><p>That gives a basic overview of messaging, from the kernel's perspective.
The Be OS also has several higher-level messaging systems, used for
different purposes, that are implemented on top of the lower-level
services. The most visible form of messaging in the Be OS is defined by
the
<code class="classname">BLooper</code> and <code class="classname">BMessage</code> classes.
A <code class="classname">BLooper</code> is an abstraction of the thread
running a message loop. <code class="classname">BMessage</code>s are posted or sent to a looper and then
dispatched to a message handler. (Release 1.1d7 sneak preview: The
BReceiver class will be renamed <code class="classname">BHandler</code>.) A
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> is a structured
collection of data. This data includes a single 4-byte 'what' identifier.
To this you can add arbitrary data entries, each entry having both a
string name and a 4-byte type identifier. You can add multiple chunks of
data under the same name and type. The data in a message is kept in what
we call the "shared heap," a heap shared by all applications in the
system. This heap is created using the kernel area API. When messages
move between threads in the same team—typically using
<code class="methodname">BLooper::PostMessage()</code>—the team is simply given the pointer to the
shared data. Things are a little more complicated when using
<code class="methodname">BMessenger::SendMessage()</code> to send a message to another team. In this case,
the address of the data in the shared heap is written into a port. Once
the destination reads the address out of the port, it has complete access
to the data of the message. This design provides for fairly efficient
messaging, as the data is only copied once—into the shared heap. From
then on it can be passed among many different threads and teams.</p><p>The Be OS clipboard and drag-and-drop mechanism are both based on the
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> object. Adding data to the clipboard is just like adding data to
a <code class="classname">BMessage</code>. Responding to a PASTE message is just like being sent a
message containing some data. Drag-and-drop works the same way. Our hope
is that leveraging the <code class="classname">BMessage</code> system makes for a simple and reusable
API.</p><p>The final data-interchange mechanism is defined by the Media Kit. The
BeBox is designed to be a dream machine for audio/video developers. One
of the big hurdles in developing applications that deal with audio/video
data is being able to efficiently move very large amounts of data between
interested parties—even those in different address spaces. The Media
Kit is designed with this in mind. At its core is the <code class="classname">BStream</code> class,
which implements a data-streaming facility
using shared memory (there's that kernel area mechanism again). The
BStream class synchronizes access to data that lives in dynamic areas of
shared memory. Each participant in the stream is given access to the
buffers present in the stream. Although <code class="classname">BStream</code> is defined in the Media
Kit, it isn't constrained to just media data: You can use the class can
for all kinds of tasks. If the API looks interesting, give it a try.</p><p>That's a brief overview of the various messaging options provided by the
Be OS. Let us know if these features suit your needs—or more
important, if they don't. Have fun!</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-13"></a>Be Developer Profile: Cronus</h2></div></div></div><p>For years, people have spoken of the Amiga as a sort of computer
Shangri-la—a great, innovative personal computer platform that was
doomed to oblivion by its manufacturer's indifference.</p><p>Fred Fish, owner of Cronus, is one of the Amiga faithful. His Tempe,
Arizona, company (formerly Amiga Library Services) still supports the
platform. But even he admits that although the Amiga is "not dead yet,
it's certainly starting to smell a little funny." He hopes the BeBox will
be able to step into the spotlight that the Amiga deserved but never got.</p><p>Fish became interested in the BeBox because "in a lot of ways, it's very
similar to how the Amiga was—with very new, innovative technology. Who
wants to work on PCs and Macs anymore? They're just not that exciting. I
know there are a lot of other people who feel that the BeBox brings back
some of the excitement that the Amiga generated. It's a good blend of
hardware and software."</p><p>Cronus has been compiling public domain software for the Amiga since
1985. "It seems obvious that one thing we might consider is doing a
compilation of freely distributable software for the BeBox" as well, Fish
says. Currently, Cronus supports the Free Software Foundation's suite of
UNIX tools on the Amiga and Fish is thinking about doing something
similar on the BeBox.</p><p>Later, he'd also like to produce a digital signal processing toolkit for
the BeBox. This toolkit would consist of "lots of utilities that would
connect together to produce simulations of larger systems," Fish says.</p><p>Eventually, Fish hopes the BeBox will become "what the Amiga should have
become, gaining very widespread acceptance." Fish hopes that one day, the
BeBox will be "one of the top three choices for people who walk into a
computer store—you'd choose between a Mac, a PC, or a BeBox."</p><p>When that day comes, the Amiga faithful will be avenged at last.</p><p>Cronus is constructing a mirror of the Be ftp site, which you'll soon be
able to find at http://ftp.ninemoons.com.</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee1-13"></a>500, The Magic Number</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>We're often asked what we think of the $500 Internet Terminal, of the
Hollow Computer, of the NC (Network Computer). All these monikers refer
in one way or another to the concept of an inexpensive Internet
appliance. This is a great concept. Who wouldn't like to have a nice $500
device for surfing the web, exchanging e-mail, and arguing in Usenet
newsgroups. And buy things, listen to news, play virtual reality network
games...</p><p>Before we look at the implementation issues, let's first deal with
personalities and human emotions. A few people and companies have given
the NC high visibility and a strong anti-Microsoft flavor. It might be
amusing to see Larry Ellison throwing barbs at Netscape, charging them
with wanting to be the Microsoft of the Internet, or to see Microsoft
dressed in the same Big Brother clothes as IBM used to be. But it doesn't
tell us much about the technical, the financial, and ultimately the
market feasibility of the NC. Even the hype doesn't matter much. It
didn't help Interactive TV or PDAs. It might even hurt, as the example of
the Newton shows. Now that it has become substantially closer to its
original claims for function, its credibility is spent, making a comeback
a long, tricky exercise. Compare this with the Psion, which sells solely
on the word-of-mouth of proud owners.</p><p>On to the implementation issues. Today, one can buy a 486-based PC for a
little over $700 retail. At Demo 96, Jim Louderback, the Editor-in-Chief
of Windows Sources, built one on stage for a little over $600, modem
included. So what is the difference between that PC and the NC? The PC is
just as capable of surfing the Net as its younger brother, it runs all
sorts of applications from games to spreadsheets, it sports a monitor and
a hard disk, and it can use inexpensive peripherals. The NC proponents
will point to a few advantages. The NC doesn't need a hard disk,
applications will be either in ROM or downloaded from the Net, including
spreadsheets and word processors. Nor does it need a monitor. To reach
the $500 retail price, not cost of goods, it will use your TV as a screen.</p><p>I have a hard time with both points. I just bought a 240 MB hard disk for
my daughter Sophie's Mac, whose older drive had died. It cost me $77,
reduced to $70 a week later. There is too much of an imbalance between
the savings realized and the loss of the nice functionality provided by a
hard disk. The applications are supposed to be loaded from the net, each
time we'll need them. They'll generate data. Where are we going to store
that data? On the net? This is "The Network Is the Computer" theory. It
works for some applications, with some customers, and with some fast,
expensive hardware and networks. Also, today's browsers need disk caches
for decent performance. Factoring caches out will require a faster
network or beaucoup RAM. More money one way or the other. As for the TV
as your screen, we know it works for games. Beyond that, it's doubtful.
In France we have the Minitel experiment, where attempts to use the TV as
a screen for the terminal were short-lived. Even with less demanding text
and graphics and direct RGB input in the back of those TVs.</p><p>The other argument in favor of the NC is the decrepitude and irrelevance
of operating systems. I have a little or a lot of biases here. Somehow, I
think, the NC will need system software to orchestrate the whole works.
The next thing you know, it will sprout a disk, a monitor, and a printer
and we'll have a web-oriented PC, at PC prices. Perhaps Oracle will sell
its reference design to the folks at AT&amp;T. After passing up on buying
Apple in 1990, buying and reselling NCR instead, investing in EGO,
General Magic, and Ziff-Davis' Interchange, AT&amp;T now enters the Internet
business. Regardless of the cost of goods, they could offer an Internet
appliance for "free" as part of a marketing campaign targeted at the
unconnected masses. The French PTT did just that with the Minitel. But
that was 15 years ago. There was no Internet and, if memory serves, it
sold a lot of Macs sporting a nice Minitel emulation.</p><p>Which leads me to my conclusion. Whether the NC evolves into a new
personal computer platform or is used as a loss leader to develop the
Internet market, it's good news, creates competition, stirs up
creativity, and makes life more interesting.</p><p>Of course, I could be all wrong. I remember the mainframe stakeholders
pooh-poohing the minis, the mini elders discounting the workstations, and
the workstation ayatollahs explaining how PCs couldn't exist by reason of
their lacking a true OS and a true network. So, I could be one of the PC
dinosaurs not seeing the combined wisdom of Lou Gerstner and Larry
Ellison. Time, or rather, customers will tell. So far, large companies
have had little success imposing new platforms. PCs, minis, workstations,
Ethernet, and the web come to mind. None have been spawned by corporate
giants.</p></div></div><div id="footer"><hr /><div id="footerT">Prev: <a href="Issue1-12.html">Issue 1-12, February 28, 1996</a>  Up: <a href="volume1.html">Volume 1: 1995–1996</a>  Next: <a href="Issue1-14.html">Issue 1-14, March 13, 1996</a> </div><div id="footerB"><div id="footerBL"><a href="Issue1-12.html" title="Issue 1-12, February 28, 1996"><img src="./images/navigation/prev.png" alt="Prev" /></a> <a href="volume1.html" title="Volume 1: 1995–1996"><img src="./images/navigation/up.png" alt="Up" /></a> <a href="Issue1-14.html" title="Issue 1-14, March 13, 1996"><img src="./images/navigation/next.png" alt="Next" /></a></div><div id="footerBR"><div><a href="http://www.haiku-os.org"><img src="./images/People_24.png" alt="haiku-os.org" title="Visit The Haiku Website" /></a></div><div class="navighome" title="Home"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="./images/navigation/home.png" alt="Home" /></a></div></div><div id="footerBC"><a href="http://www.access-company.com/home.html" title="ACCESS Co."><img alt="Access Company" src="./images/access_logo.png" /></a></div></div></div><div id="licenseFooter"><div id="licenseFooterBL"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" title="Creative Commons License"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/3.0/88x31.png" /></a></div><div id="licenseFooterBR"><a href="./LegalNotice.html">Legal Notice</a></div><div id="licenseFooterBC"><span id="licenseText">This work is licensed under a
