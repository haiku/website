One of the questions we get a lot here at Be is, "Why PEF?" And to be
perfectly honest, it's a good question. After all, there's a time for
innovation and a time for slavish compliance to existing standards, and
it's important to know the difference. It's true for Be, and I think it's
even true for Apple.
</p><p>
PEF is Apple's proprietary executable file format for the PowerPC
Macintoshes. Think about that: A proprietary executable file format. It's
even hard for me to type. Just plain weird. Don't make sense. An
executable file format is just no place to be different. But this is
Apple we're talking about.
</p><p>
So what's so great about PEF? Well, that's not clear to me either. To be
fair, it is a nice, modern executable file format with support for demand
paging of code, shared libraries and dynamic loading and linking. Just
like ELF and XCOFF. It differs from these in really only one regard:
There's a nice feature that allows for the compression of non-zero
pre-initialized data. In ELF and XCOFF, if you have zero initialized data
(known as .BSS to us old timers), its location and length is marked and
you don't carry a bunch of zeros around in your executable. Sometimes,
however, you have repetitive (read "compressible") pre-initialized data.
For example, if the following appeared as global data in your
application, the linker could take advantage of PEF's handy compression
feature and reduce the size of your executable:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">very_important_table</code>[300000] = { 12345 };
</pre><p>
Now, saving around 1,200,000 bytes for this fascinating construct is
pretty cool, but is it worth total incompatibility with all the other
programming tools in the world? And is it patentable?
</p><p>
I bring this up because Apple believes there's something very special
about this stuff. Whether it's patentable, patented, or just an important
trade secret is unclear, even after conversations with Apple's lawyers.
We at Be wrote our PEF loader in the kernel by using publicly available
documents, but nonetheless it appears we need to pay Apple a license fee
for the right to open and interpret PEF files. Oh well.
</p><p>
We can puzzle over Apple's wisdom in this or any other regard, but life
is short. We can move on to another vexing question, "Why does Be bother
with PEF?" The reason we're using PEF is because of Metrowerks. We love
their tools—they're the best available for the Power PC—and we
wanted our early developers to be able to use CodeWarrior on the Mac as a
cross-development platform while the young BeBox was becoming more
stable. The only executable format supported by CodeWarrior is PEF, so we
complied.
</p><p>
In recent months, we've been asked by a number of developers if we could
support a more standard format, such as ELF. Our response has been
positive, but vague. Positive because we'd prefer the more standard
route, but vague because sharing one object library (libbe.so, currently
a PEF behemoth) between both PEF and ELF applications is tricky.
Convincing Metrowerks to support ELF at all has also been a little more
difficult than we thought it would be. Nonetheless, we strive to an even
more standard future.

In 1991 I got fired—even though I was putting in 12-plus hour days --
because I wasn't willing to show up for work at 10:00 am each morning
(1:00 pm works much better for me). So I figured the time was right to
return to the contract programming business I'd started three years
earlier: Green Dragon Creations.
</p><p>
At Green Dragon we write games for companies coast to coast. One of our
first big contracts was "Spectre Supreme"; our next two products (for the
Macintosh) are "MechWarrior 2" and "Under a Killing Moon."
</p><p>
Writing games is the best job in the world. It lets me combine two of the
things I love most: Programming and playing games. Writing games is a
sort of game in and of itself—balancing object-oriented programming
with efficient code.
</p><p>
We'll work on any platform except DOS/Windoze/Win95. We'll work on
Macintosh, Sega Saturn, Sony Playstation, and we're looking forward to
developing for the Be platform! Every platform needs games, right?
</p><p>
I look for a few key things when choosing a platform. On the high end
(for example, on the BeBox or Macintosh), I look for good tools and a
good OS/Toolbox to use as a foundation for what I want to write. On the
low end (for example, on the Sega Saturn), I look for a cool set of chips
and just enough sample code to write my own OS for the system. I love to
get down to the bare metal and build an efficient object-oriented system
from the ground up.
</p><p>
I especially like the <span class="trademark">Be OS</span>™. I look at the basic docs and how the OS
is put together and it looks like a clean, efficient system. I want to
build games on top of it. It's the first system since the Macintosh where
the mouse actually works correctly.
</p><p>
To start out with, we'd like to port our own code (a 3D sprite engine) to
the Be platform. We'd also like to convince our clients to let us port
some of the games we've ported to the Macintosh over to the BeBox. Stay
tuned!

Last week I referred to Bill Walsh. As a result, I got a good ration of
ribbing: “<span class="quote">How can a Frenchman raised on soccer even begin to appreciate
the subtle nuances of American Football?</span>” As a matter of fact, I endured
an overdose of soccer in Roman Catholic boarding school, and I'm watching
the calendar for Labor Day when I can compare Jimmy Johnson's hairdo to
Mike Ditka's.
</p><p>
But I won't invoke past or present coaches in vain anymore. So, we'll
skip Vince Lombardi and focus this week on our definition of winning. How
do we know—when will we know that we've won? Is it the day of the
sacrosanct IPO? Is it when we win our first lawsuit against Bill Lerach,
when we ship the first 100,000 machines, or reach 100 million dollars in
revenues? Or is it when we see Be Geeks on a magazine cover, read
accolades in "Upside," and watch Erich Ringewald, tanned and tattooed, in
a sunset fade on his sailboat?
</p><p>
There's a difficulty and fragility in any definition of winning. Remember
"Business Week's" 1984 cover, "And the Winner is IBM"? The joke gets
cosmically better when we realize IBM never made a buck in the PC
business. At the time, Apple was perceived to be the loser, after years
of winning with the Apple II, and before years of winning with the
Macintosh. Ashton-Tate won for a while, so did Software Publishing, but
—unlike Apple with the Mac—they failed to make a transition and
never recovered.
</p><p>
Then there's Microsoft. They never seem to have lost. Sure, they were the
unintentional fool in the database court for a while, but the laughter
stopped when they acquired FoxPro (for a fraction of the price Borland
paid for Ashton-Tate), and blew life into their second database product,
Access.
</p><p>
The moral seems to be about winning seasons rather than scores in
particular games. And yet, some teams with winning seasons get their
names spelled with four L's. So let's pick a definition of winning and
see if it fits.
</p><p>
First, there is the win for developers: For Be to win, our developers
must win. We have a unique opportunity to help fresh starts in the
application business, just as we are a fresh start in the platform
business. I'll make the risque statement that it's more important for us
to find the next Adobe than to convince Adobe that Be is their next
platform (this said with great respect for Adobe technical prowess and
aesthetic elegance). Yes, it would be great to run a Be-specific version
of Photoshop—and it would be even greater to find the next John
Warnock or the next Kai Krause. We would add more to the industry and
we'd probably get more as well.
</p><p>
Perception will add to the win: Being seen as a platform on which new
stars are born will attract more talent. As we win with and for
developers, we'll win with customers. We give them features and
price/performance unavailable elsewhere, they help us reach financial
independence, thus the very perception of success begets success.
</p><p>
Our shareholders (including Be employees) are next in line. If the
company is financially sound, there will be people wanting to buy shares.
Winning, in this sense, is making our professional investors liquid, and
helping Be employees along the road to freedom of mortgage.
</p><p>
We also want to win by impressing our severest critics: Ourselves. If
you'll allow the momentary immodesty, we're driven by qualitative and
aesthetic gauges. We do what we do because we hold to a high standard
when we measure the quality of personal computing, applications, and the
building of good businesses. To win in this arena means creating a
product that feels right, through the combination of the ingenuity of its
design, the integrity of its proportions, the quality of its execution,
and the hone sty of its distribution.
</p><p>
This may sound a bit too trite for your taste; but I can offer the names
of companies that won in some—but not all—of the constituencies
listed above. They didn't last. That consideration drives us also. The
Amiga was/is a great computer, but Commodore didn't last.
</p><p>
Yes, we are naive enough to think we can win, and we're experienced
enough to know that the future will surprise us no less than the past
5-1/2 years have.

the most attended and contentious of the recent BeDevTalk threads and

The BeBox lacks a help system. Currently, favor runs to:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>HTML (or, more generally, SGML) as the help document format</li><li>Help documents stored in app-specific subdirectories of a central help directory</li><li>The need for both contextual and "big-page" help (in Mac-speak: "Balloon Help/Apple Guide")</li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id488618"></a>Subject: Hierarcical tables? and more...</h3></div></div></div><p>
The design and philosophy of database tables is discussed. Some
questions: Since tables are identified by their names, should the
storage server provide some sort of name management? Participants
appreciate that tables are global creatures (and so allow apps to
easily share data), but should ALL tables be public?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: The design and implementation of the database (including
the file system) is being revisited. We expect to announce the new
design sometime *after* DR8.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id488641"></a>Subject: Call for type/creator reorganization<br /></h3></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">
A/K/A: File type proposal<br />
A/K/A: Be All and End All - A Proposal for "Be Types" (long)
</h4></div></div></div><p>
Is Be's four-byte document "type" identifier good enough? Alternatives
were suggested and debated (MIME, in particular). Similarly, the
application-identifying "creator" was examined—some folks question
its necessity.
</p><p>
For a good, detailed overview of this fiendishly long and winding
thread, see the page that Chris Herborth put together at
http://www.qnx.com/~chrish/Be/FileTypes.html.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: The file system/database redesign will address most of the
issues raised in this thread.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id488677"></a>Subject: Dynamic docks and mouse buttons</h3></div></div></div><p>
Related to (and sprouted from) the type/creator thread, the arguments
in this thread broach interface issues: Given a file, how can the user
most easily find and launch the app that will best display the file's
contents? To this end, a "dynamic dock" was proposed in which a palette
of candidate file-opening apps is displayed when you drag a file icon.
Subject: Storage Kit limitations (request for UNIX features)
</p><p>
A number of file system features are seen to be lacking: Mountable
foreign file systems, network file systems, symbolic links, memory
mapped files. Many solutions/suggestions have been offered and rebutted.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Have no doubt that foreign file systems (in particular of
the shortcomings mentioned in the thread) will be supported. Finding
the "correct" solution will be one of the primary tasks in the file
system rewrite (which, as mentioned above, is scheduled for post-DR8).

This thread concentrates on a proposed "modularization" of interface
elements, the app server, the Browser, the shell, and so on. Advocates
of configurable look and feel would like to be able to replace small
GUIpieces (such as scrollbars) as well as entire systems (the shell,
the window drawing portion of the app server).
Subject: Java ports?
A/K/A: Plugin Format (JAVA!)
</p><p>
Anybody want to port JAVA? Some questions regarding JAVA security (and
efficiency) grew into a wider pondering of how different languages
should transmit script-like requests between processes.

This thread suggests that GUI and UNIX needn't be so beastly to each
other. With no nay-saying (so far), the participants take a "why not?"
attitude toward such things as a cron app and "visual" (UNIX) pipes.

Complaints and suggestions regarding certain aspects of the UI, notably
"choice-enforcement" buttons in preferences panels (and other such

Be, Inc. didn't attend PC Expo. Some participants wonder how this
absence can be explained.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: We simply don't have the bandwidth to attend every
conference and expo. Furthermore, while PC Expo is important to the PC
user industry, attendance by our audience (developers) is small. Had we
attended the Expo, we would have had to short-change some other
developer-heavy conferences (MacHack, MacWorld, Be's European GeekFest,
etc.). Look for us at PC Expo '97.
