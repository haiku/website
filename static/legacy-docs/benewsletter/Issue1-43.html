Two weeks ago, a question was posted (to comp.sys.be) asking about the
proper way to animate a large number of pixels inside a window. It seems
that <code class="methodname">FillRect()</code> isn't as fast as the application writer wants.
</p><p>
You ask for it—you get it; I figured it might be fun to spend a Sunday
evening looking at ways to draw quixels pickly. I took my favorite guinea
pig program—HelloWorld—and changed the <code class="methodname">Draw()</code> function to benchmark
different techniques.
</p><p>
First I tried <code class="methodname">FillRect()</code>. The code looks something like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">HelloView</code>::<code class="methodname">Draw</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code>)
{
  <span class="type">double</span>  <code class="varname">start</code>;
  <span class="type">double</span>  <code class="varname">end</code>;
  <span class="type">long</span>  <code class="varname">i</code>;
  <code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">r</code>;

  <code class="varname">r</code>.<code class="methodname">Set</code>(10,10,10,10);

  <code class="varname">start</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();

  for (<code class="varname">i</code> = 0; <code class="varname">i</code> &lt; 10000; i++) {
    <code class="methodname">FillRect</code>(<code class="varname">r</code>);
  }

  <code class="methodname">Flush()</code>;
  <code class="varname">end</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();
  <code class="function">printf</code>("t = %f\n", (<code class="varname">end</code>-<code class="varname">start</code>)/10000.0);
}
</pre><p>
On my beloved 66 MHz BeBox, a single <code class="methodname">FillRect()</code> takes about 75
microseconds. At 15 frames per second, you would be able to animate an
area of about 888 pixels (isn't BC a great toy...). Not too bad, but how
much faster can we go?
</p><p>
Next test was to use <code class="methodname">MovePenTo()</code> and <code class="methodname">StrokeLine()</code>. I changed the loop to
look like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
for (<code class="varname">i</code> = 0; <code class="varname">i</code> &lt; 10000; <code class="varname">i</code>++) {
  <code class="methodname">MovePenTo</code>(<code class="classname">BPoint</code>(10,10));
  <code class="methodname">StrokeLine</code>(<code class="classname">BPoint</code>(10,10));
}
</pre><p>
This time, 73 microseconds. 2.666% better than <code class="methodname">FillRect()</code>. My jaw it was
undropped. Perhaps we're getting into the overhead of the general
protocol? Disabling the window discipline decreased the overhead somewhat
—down to 66 microseconds. We're headed in the right direction, but...
</p><p>
Let's try something that naturally has a much faster protocol:
<code class="methodname">LineArray()</code>. Now the function looks like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">HelloView</code>::<code class="methodname">Draw</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code>)
{
  <span class="type">double</span> <code class="varname">start</code>;
  <span class="type">double</span>  <code class="varname">end</code>;
  <span class="type">long</span> <code class="varname">i</code>,<code class="varname">j</code>;
  <span class="type">rgb_color</span>  <code class="varname">c</code>;

  <code class="varname">c</code>.<code class="varname">red</code> = 0;
  <code class="varname">c</code>.<code class="varname">green</code> = 0;
  <code class="varname">c</code>.<code class="varname">blue</code> = 0;

  <code class="varname">start</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();

  for (<code class="varname">i</code> = 0; <code class="varname">i</code> &lt; 10000/32; <code class="varname">i</code>++) {
    <code class="methodname">BeginLineArray</code>(32);
    for (<code class="varname">j</code> = 0; <code class="varname">j</code> &lt; 32; <code class="varname">j</code>++) {
      <code class="methodname">AddLine</code>(<code class="classname">BPoint</code>(10,10), <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(10,10),<code class="varname">c</code>);
      <code class="methodname">EndLineArray</code>();
    }
  }
  <code class="methodname">Flush</code>();
  <code class="varname">end</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();
  <code class="function">printf</code>("t = %f\n", (<code class="varname">end</code>-<code class="varname">start</code>)/10000.0);
}
</pre><p>
16 microseconds per pixel! Disable discipline and we get down to 11
microseconds. That's an area of 4100 pixels at 15 frames per second.
</p><p>
Can we do even better? Yes—but not without cheating. Try this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">HelloView</code>::<code class="methodname">Draw</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code>)
{
  <span class="type">double</span>  <code class="varname">start</code>;
  <span class="type">double</span>  <code class="varname">end</code>;
  <span class="type">long</span>  <code class="varname">i</code>;
  <code class="classname">BRect</code>  <code class="varname">r</code>;
  <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>  *<code class="varname">b</code>;
  <span class="type">rgb_color</span>  <code class="varname">c</code>;
  <span class="type">long</span>  <code class="varname">x</code>;
  <span class="type">long</span>  <code class="varname">y</code>;
  <span class="type">char  *</span><code class="varname">p</code>;

  <code class="varname">r</code>.<code class="methodname">Set</code>(0,0,255,255);
  <code class="varname">b</code> = new <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">r</code>, <code class="constant">B_COLOR_8_BIT</code>);

  <code class="varname">start</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();

  <code class="varname">x</code> = 10;
  <code class="varname">y</code> = 10;

  for (<code class="varname">i</code> = 0; <code class="varname">i</code> &lt; 10000; <code class="varname">i</code>++) {
    <code class="varname">p</code> = (<span class="type">char</span> *)<code class="varname">b</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Bits</code>() + <code class="varname">b</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">BytesPerRow</code>()*<code class="varname">y</code> + <code class="varname">x</code>;
    *<code class="varname">p</code> = 20;
  }
  <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">b</code>, <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(0,0));
  <code class="varname">end</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();
  delete <code class="varname">b</code>;

  <code class="function">printf</code>("t = %f\n", (<code class="varname">end</code>-<code class="varname">start</code>)/10000.0);
}
</pre><p>
Since we're simply blitting a bitmap, this isn't a general solution. But
it is fast—0.82 usec per pixel, enough to animate 81300 pixels at 15
fps. Of course, the bitmap that we're creating in the loop is, shall we
say, restrained: We really are just poking the same pixel over and over.
But the point of this experiment is to get a feel for our absolute best
time. The key to approaching this time is to keep the pixel position
computation at a minimum.
</p><p>
A few weeks ago, I wrote about the enhanced performance of
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code> (vs <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code>).
In the example above, we only draw
once, so <code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code> doesn't really apply. But what happens if we
put the draw call into the loop? First we try <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">HelloView</code>::<code class="methodname">Draw</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code>)
{
  <span class="type">double</span>  <code class="varname">start</code>;
  <span class="type">double</span>  <code class="varname">end</code>;
  <span class="type">long</span>  <code class="varname">i</code>;
  <code class="classname">BRect</code>  <code class="varname">r</code>;
  <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>  *<code class="varname">b</code>;

  <code class="varname">r</code>.<code class="methodname">Set</code>(0,0,7,7);
  <code class="varname">b</code> = new <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">r</code>, <code class="constant">B_COLOR_8_BIT</code>);

  <code class="varname">start</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();

  for (<code class="varname">i</code> = 0; <code class="varname">i</code> &lt; 10000; <code class="varname">i</code>++) {
    <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">b</code>, <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(10,10));
  }
  <code class="methodname">Sync</code>();
  <code class="varname">end</code> = <code class="function">system_time</code>();
  delete <code class="varname">b</code>;
  <code class="function">printf</code>("t = %f\n", (<code class="varname">end</code>-<code class="varname">start</code>)/10000.0);
}
</pre><p>
This produces a horrendous 875 usec per bitmap! That's the price you pay
for synchronous operations and context switches! By using
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code> instead of <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code>, we get down to 160 usec per
bitmap. That's fast enough to draw 416 little icons at 15 fps.
</p><p>
Of course, you can always mix the two techniques: Try using custom code
to (repeatedly) blit a small bitmap into a bigger bitmap. When it comes
to animation, nothing will beat a clean custom piece of code.
</p><p>
By the way, I did a quick test on a 133 MHz BeBox. In most cases the
performance is close to 3x better... J'aime ces caches L1 !

The crowd followed the leader's every movement, banging their sticks in
zombie-like unison. Thousands of sticks, hollow and of different lengths,
produced a pseudo-musical sound that pulsed a communal heartbeat. The
followers were rapt, staring at the stage as their leader jumped and
shouted commands left and right.
</p><p>
I was witnessing a company picnic. And it wasn't Be's.
</p><p>
"Am I safe?" I shouted to my roommate as we entered the throng at
Shoreline Amphitheater.
</p><p>
"Sure, just stay close to me!" He shouted in reply. "And don't make any
sudden movements!"
</p><p>
My roommate had coaxed me into coming to his company's picnic by assuring
me that the music, food, people, and lip sync competition would be "a ton
of fun." He hadn't mentioned mass hypnosis and ritual sacrifice.
</p><p>
After the banging, during which the leader shouted group hug mottos about
"adapting to change" and "meeting new challenges," they did indeed have a
lip sync competition. The competition included a distressingly large
number of male engineers duped into sliding on nylons and into drag queen
acts. Don't get me wrong; I had a fine time during the show, but I was
glad I wouldn't be going to work with these folks on Monday.
</p><p>
Still, I couldn't help wonder whether Be would evolve into this sort of
monstrosity. Will Be become a zillion-dollar company with representatives
in every country on the planet and division acronyms that are totally
unrecognizable to the engineering staff? Will Be wheel out a gray-haired
Erich Ringewald to judge lip sync competitions? I had a hard time
imagining Steve Horowitz up on stage at Shoreline, giving the Mother of
All Demos to a thousands-strong mass of employees and leading them in
chants of "The System is Still Responsive! The System is Still
Responsive!"
</p><p>
Right now, Be could barely fill the first row of Shoreline. The company
is small, and I love it. I know everybody in the company. I get to
respond to Webmaster e-mail personally (webmaster@be.com), and make the
web site seem a little more human. Being the Webmaster, I also get
excited about Be's potential for using the web. Every time I read one of
Jean- Louis' future-of-the-web articles, I get pumped up. Before coming
to work for Be, I figured they'd always just send it to their "Internet
Division" or something. But now, the "Internet Division" is me. Gulp.
</p><p>
The web site has made some great strides recently, namely the new look,
designed by Mark Gonzales, which coincided with the MacWorld
announcements. But even more improvements are in the works. On my
whiteboard there's a list of planned web site improvements as long as my
arm, waiting to be tackled. On-line ordering is up and running, but the
capability to do secure transactions still needs to be added. Developers
have a Registered Developer Area of the web site, which requires a
password to enter, allowing us to distribute information in a more
targeted manner.
</p><p>
In the Registered Developer Area, developers can now modify the contact
information we keep for them on-line. They can keep us up to date about
their latest projects. And soon, they'll be able to add their own
projects to <span class="trademark">BeWare</span>™. Personally, I'm excited about this. It will give
all developers an opportunity to alert end users (as well as other
developers) to the presence of their applications. Freeware, shareware,
and commercial applications can sit alongside each other, with web, ftp,
and e-mail links guiding the web surfer.
</p><p>
I think the BeWare section of the web site has a lot of potential. At
NASA, I used to use a graphing program for the Mac called "Igor Pro" (by
Wavemetrics). It had a novel way of displaying data (as "waves"), was
extremely powerful, and you could even script it. It was great—and I
never would have heard of it had one of my co-workers not sworn by it as
the best graphing program he'd ever seen. After all, how do applications
usually gain notoriety? Magazine reviews, software catalogs, and word of
mouth, apparently. And those are only commercial applications --
shareware applications are doomed to skulk in the shadows, hoping that
enough users tell their friends, in a "chain letter" approach to
advertising.
</p><p>
BeWare should help change that: One-stop shopping for freeware,
shareware, and commercial Be applications. And searchable, too. I can't
wait to be able to run a search on "Game" and "3D" in order to check out
the latest 3D games for the <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™. (For testing purposes only, of
course.)
</p><p>
We have more improvements for the web site in the works: A better search
engine, a Reseller Area styled after the ID &amp; Password Registered
Developer Area, searchable archives of BeDevTalk posts, a number of
list-server upgrades, better ftp site integration with the web site, and
on-line mailing list subscription capabilities. Over time, these
functions will be integrated.
</p><p>
The Internet Division is hard at work on it.

I've been writing software since 1985, when I got my Commodore 64. I
replaced it with an Atari 1040ST in 1986; it was over ten years old when
I finally put it in storage—it had to go to make room for my BeBox.
</p><p>
By day, I'm an R&amp;D technical writer for QNX Software Systems Ltd.
(http://www.qnx.com/), a small, privately owned high- tech company in
Kanata, Ontario, who develops QNX, the leading real-time OS for PCs.
Working for QNX is great. In addition to writing, I get to make use of my
hacker talents. I implemented our SGML documentation process and
programmed all the support tools.
</p><p>
Day job aside, I've always had a goal in the back of my mind: To develop
role-playing games based on a programmable engine that could (in theory)
handle any game in any genre. I've got some pretty high-end demands for
this thing: 32-bit alpha channel graphics (so you can see fish swimming
in the stream); separate threads for every actor, as well as for the
animation and audio; a built-in programming language for designing the
game. To support these ideals, I need a system with some decent
horsepower. And to feed my own desires, I need a system that's
interesting, one that's not flooded with shovelware.
</p><p>
The BeBox announcement excited me the way the Amiga and Atari ST excited
me in 1986. Fresh, new systems, uncharted territory, and a groovy feeling
that accountants and lawyers would never use this box in their day jobs.
A complete lack of software is annoying yet very exciting... the
possibility of an incredible set of new applications is fantastic, since
we're not burdened with bloated apps and the Microsoft monopoly. The fact
that the BeOS supports everything in my wish-list of OS features
(something no other OS has done) and that it was affordable to someone
who's still paying for sending himself through university really caught
my eye. A clean C++ API is a bonus (even though I prefer dynamically
typed languages).
</p><p>
I'm currently developing my dream game engine on the BeBox; the working
title is Arcana. To support the engine, I need to create other useful
utilities, such as a graphics editor suited to working with small tiles
stored in PNG format, and the Arcana WorldBuilder (a sort of BeIDE for
creating computer role-playing games), and who knows what else along the
way.
</p><p>
After I finish Arcana and the Arcana WorldBuilder, I'm going to start
creating top-notch role-playing games. This will be done when it's done;
I'm going to start updating my web pages (http://www.qnx.com/~chrish)
soon, and will have a log of what's finished, what I'm working on, and
what I plan on doing.
</p><p>
While I'm designing Arcana, I've got loads of other interesting ideas
floating around in my head... games, utilities, applications, silly
hacks, who knows what. I've already ported an EMACS-like editor (jove),
Info-ZIP's archiving utilities (zip and unzip), and a bunch of other
goodies. When I get a spare week or two, I'm planning on porting STonX,
an Atari ST emulator for UNIX systems. These things get posted on my web
pages and sent to ftp.be.com as I finish them.
</p><p>
One other very exciting thing that I'm working on is a port of id
Software's DOOM. Yes folks, we'll have a nice version of DOOM (running in
a window or running full-screen via the Game Kit—your choice).
Progress on this isn't as fast as I'd like—I do have to go to work --
but it's coming along nicely. After the id guys check it out, I'll be
unleashing a beta test version; it'll work with existing WAD files, do
UDP networking, stereo sound, MIDI (maybe, if I can borrow a MIDI device
of some sort), everything. If you want to speed things up, send me money
so I can take time off work. Or a cloning machine to hook to the
<span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™. But PLEASE don't e-mail me to ask about DOOM; check my web
pages instead. I'll be posting development logs soon.
</p><p>
I also plan on doing a port of Dr. Cat's DragonSpires client.
DragonSpires (http://www.eden.com/~cat/) is a graphical MUD on the
Internet, featuring an Ultima-like display. And did I mention that I was
writing a few Be programming tutorials? You should expect to see them in
a new Be e-zine soon. But that's a secret. I'd love to write a book or
two about programming the BeBox at some point, too.
</p><p>
Obviously, I'm pretty busy in my spare time.
</p><p>
Be's developer support has been top-notch. Much better than any other
tech support group that I've ever dealt with (well, QNX's tech support
people are great, but I usually don't deal with them). Of course, there's
always room for improvement: Getting a searchable database of bug reports
and feature requests up on their web pages would be a great start.
</p><p>
The documentation in "The Be Book" could be better. More example code for
common uses (such as how to get all the file references out of
BApplication's RefsReceived() argument) would be nice. The Be developer
community helps a lot here. Posting a question to BeDevTalk is a great
way to get answers. You can tell we love the system because of the number
of religious wars that go on in BeDevTalk. Jake Hamby's experimental news
server (at muppet.jpl.nasa.gov) is also good (and doesn't get so noisy).
</p><p>
In the newsletter, I'd like to see some information from the developers
at Be about what they plan on implementing, sort of a "crystal ball"
column. Even if it's full of "plans change" and "we might do it another
way" and "we might never get around to this" comments, I'd still love to
have some idea of where the BeOS is heading. It can be frustrating (and
lead to a zillion feature requests) not knowing what'll be in the next OS
revision until it actually ships.

This morning I met with a reporter. He asked me to respond to a statement
by one of the people I admire in our industry, Tim Gill, the founder of
Quark. With all the caveats about second-hand information well
stipulated, Tim said something to the effect he wouldn't port Quark
Xpress to the BeOS. Quark was more interested, and busy as hell, in
moving their product forward on the Mac and Windows than in making a
"lateral" move to an unproven platform such as Be's.
</p><p>
A very logical position, one that is shared by many of the established
developers. They have a lot invested in their franchise, why would they
risk it on a new platform?
</p><p>
I'm not sure I can give an unequivocal "Yes, you should" retort. Are we
better off with new developers, unproven but unencumbered by their pasts
—just like us? Or do we need the name, the marketing power, and the
"code base" of a proven leader? There's no simple answer. Some companies
have fared well in lateral moves, porting their product from Mac to
Windows, or vice versa. Others have wasted their time—and their
shareholders' resources. Sometimes the problem is the famous "code base."
A successful product doesn't mean what went in the sausage was pristine.
The port, even with the latest tools, can take a long time and perform
poorly. Other times, the problem is management or marketing. The culture,
the habits, the metrics of Mac and Windows users are more different than
either group realizes, and the product or its marketing misses the mark.
Excel works well across platforms, but even mighty Microsoft couldn't
avoid a dud like the latest revision of Word on the Mac. I could mention
other so-so examples, but I'd rather point out Photoshop as an example of
a product successfully "lateraled" from the Macintosh to Windows and
various flavors of UNIX, probably the result of the combined virtues of
management and code base.
</p><p>
New developers have much in their favor. They tend to think more
innovatively, and they will write fresh code targeted to our platform
rather than attempt to "repurpose" their "code base." The difference in
function and performance could be as striking as the one we see between
the mature MacOS and the BeOS when they both run on the same hardware.
And, on the BeOS, new developers, unlike established ones, do not have to
fear alienating software distributors; therefore they can market and
distribute their software on the web.
</p><p>
Does this mean we have no interest in proven, successful developers? Of
course not. Some people even suggest I should go and sleep on John
Warnock's doorstep until he decides to port Photoshop to the BeOS. We
first have to complete our port of the BeOS on PowerMacs, thus ensuring a
much larger installed base for BeOS applications. Then, we might have to
provide tools that facilitate the adaptation of some, not all,
well-designed applications to the BeOS. In this context, the opposite of
well-designed are applications written in such a way that only a total
rewrite will allow them to fully use the competitive features of the
BeOS. In this case, a "straight" port will probably feel lame—not
recommended.

When we have the migration tools and the PowerMac port on a CD, I'll give
Tim Gill a call.
