The happy campers among you who, day after day, enjoy the presence of a
BeBox may have already removed the chassis cover to see if we really
shipped two PowerPCs per BeBox ("...yup, there they are..."). The most
courageous may then have decided to take a further look at the
motherboard; eight SIMM slots (check), ISA slots (check), PCI (check)
third processor socket (che...what??? sorry, it's just the logic analyzer
port).
</p><p>
And over here we have the U30...
</p><p>
The U30 is an 8-bit microcontroller located between the logic analyzer
port and the ISA slots. More congenially, the U30 is the infrared (IR)
chip. This article describes the history and features of this chip.
</p><p>
The goal of the BeBox IR port is to enable the BeBox to interact with
consumer IR devices. Not only can the IR port receive commands from a
regular IR remote control, it can send control signals to an external
device—in other words, you can turn your BeBox into a big blue remote
control. The goal for now isn't to support standards like IrDa, we just
want a cool feature (almost as cool as the <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™).
</p><p>
In implementing the port, we needed to find an IR format that we could
support. The original idea was to sample a few specific remote controls
and then try to understand all the messages that they could send. We
planned on choosing generic, programmable models that had large numbers
of keys. On the out-going side, we needed to be able to sample an IR
sequence and reconstitute it later. Finally, we wanted the transceiver
(the box that receives and sends the IR signals) that's plugged into the
IR port to be as simple as possible... ideally, as simple as an IR LED
(for the emitting side). Consumer IR signals are time modulated, so in
addition to broadcasting data, the IR port needs to deliver a
time-modulated signal.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, after gathering information about IR and sampling all the
IR remote controls that were lying around at Be, we concluded that no two
protocols were exactly alike. (Some conclusion!) For example, each time
you press a key, you send a data field and an identification field
related to the device. Hmm.... Timings, data and identification fields,
synchronization fields, modulation frequency, repeat patterns—all
different!
</p><p>
It was time to resort to the old science fiction standby: The "universal
translator." You have a room filled with people from Earth, Venus, and
outer space colonies—yet everyone is speaking English! (How
convenient.) What does it mean? In order to ease communication, you
accept that you will lose part of the data that you receive when someone
is talking to you, particularly language-specific nuances. In fact, you
don't even know what language the other person is using. The only problem
is that your universal translator has to recognize every language that it
hears; if the range of languages is too broad to *teach* it each one (or
if new languages are created), then the translator has to have the
ability to *learn* new languages on its own. Back on Earth, California,
Menlo Park, that's what our IR chip tries to do.
</p><p>
First of all, the tasks of listening to a remote control (so you can
control the BeBox by using a remote), and emitting IR signals (so you can
control an external device from the BeBox) are clearly divided into two
modes: The first we call "analysis" mode; the second is "sampling" mode.
</p><p>
To use the BeBox to receive IR signals, you put the chip in analysis mode
and then teach it what to listen for by punching the set of keys (on the
remote control) that you want to use. During analysis, the chip looks for
a set of (eight or fewer) bits that remain constant; it assumes that this
is the identification field for your remote control. It then assumes that
the changing bits (again, as many as eight) make up the data field.
</p><p>
Once a remote control has been analyzed, the data can be stored in a
library of remote control settings. By choosing a remote from the
library, the user tells the chip to begin listening for signals that
match the analysis data. The chip then only processes incoming messages
that contain the proper ID bits. The chip can listen to three different
remote controls at the same time: There are three IR channels, and each
channel can be set up to recognize a different ID.
</p><p>
Sending IR signals to an external device also requires a learning phase.
You put the chip in sampling mode and then (once again) step through the
remote control keys that you're interested in. In sampling mode, however,
there's no analysis—the chip is simply recording the signals that it
receives. Later, when the user is using the BeBox to control an external
device, the chip simply plays back the signal that corresponds to a
particular requested function. Thus, for example, when you want to use
your BeBox to tell your television to change to channel 65, the IR chip
simply replays the "change to channel 65" signal.
</p><p>
This raises a question: Why doesn't the IR chip use the analyzed data for
output as well as input? Why does it have to play back a recorded signal
when it's talking to an external device, rather than synthesizing the
signal from the analysis data? It's a valid request—but,
unfortunately, it can't be done (at least not yet). During analysis, a
lot of important information is lost; only the ID and data field
information is retained, everything else—timing information in
particular—is thrown away.
</p><p>
Although a few remote controls won't work with the BeBox, a very large
number of brands are supported. Still to come is the software that will
use the IR chip.

After a somewhat mediocre career in undergraduate physics, I decided that
a different course of action was in order. So I became a hacker.
</p><p>
I've done a variety of things with computers. My great love is graphics
—especially algorithms for generating really cool images, or for
transforming existing images. I played extensively with ray tracing and
image manipulation (sharpening, enhancing, posterizing, and so on)—I
know, I know, most of these tools are readily available for many
different platforms, but I wanted to write my own. Besides, being an
Amiga fan, I have little choice in the matter.
</p><p>
After a couple of jobs in the industry (including writing PDF conversion
software at MasterSoft), I decided to start writing software for myself
again. As the sole employee of Leonid Software, I consult by day and
write the software that I really want to write in the evenings. I've got
several software ideas kicking around:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A <acronym class="acronym">PNG</acronym> graphic toolchest, to convert images to and from <acronym class="acronym">PNG</acronym> (a
relatively new graphic file format), to view them, to apply
transformations to them, and to edit the various chunks that comprise a
<acronym class="acronym">PNG</acronym> file, as well as to append new chunks.
</p></li><li><p>
A <acronym class="acronym">PDF</acronym> viewing application, useful to developers since much on-line
documentation is now written in the <acronym class="acronym">PDF</acronym> file format.
</p></li><li><p>
I'm negotiating with a game development company to port a sound
toolkit to the BeBox.
</p></li></ul><p>
The BeBox for me is like the Amiga—full of promise and capable of
doing more with less. To me, the idea of an inexpensive multiprocessing
personal computer is a logical next step in PC evolution, and I'm amazed
nobody has pushed such a design previously. The <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™ is clean,
object-oriented, and logical. The GUI is simple, yet slick.
</p><p>
The BeBox has let me recapture the euphoria I had lost when I sold my
Amiga 3000 to pay for a Pentium box. On the down side, there are plenty
of bugs and shortcomings to work out. I'm particularly annoyed at the
lack of support for foreign file systems in the BeOS—one simply
expects to be able to read an ISO 9660 CD-ROM volume without effort! But
the hardware is good (thank you, Be, for including SCSI as a standard
bus!), and the OS is constantly being improved. So the immediate
shortcomings can be overlooked.
</p><p>
I plan on making my BeBox products available as shareware over the
Internet. That's really the best distribution method for a one-man show
like myself. In the long run, I'd like to create a whole suite of
document and graphic processing applications for the BeBox, and I think
it's not unrealistic for a company starting small to do this. That's how
others have started. As for my target audience, it's clearly graphics and
DTP enthusiasts (with a heavy leaning toward graphics initially, because
for me that's less difficult).

In coming weeks we'll be featuring a column by Pierre Raynaud-Richard
that will address two components of the upcoming Developer Release 8 of
the BeOS: The Game Kit and the 3-D Kit. This marks an important step in
the evolution of the BeOS and, as such, deserves some clarification and
expanding upon the philosophy behind our moves.
</p><p>
First, the Game Kit. As Pierre points out, he wrote a fairly basic first
installment with enough functionality to encourage use and feedback --
feedback we'll use for the "fully functional" revision. After that we'll
be in "continuous improvement" mode, until technology or market changes
call for a major release. That's the theory, a little too tidy perhaps
when compared to implementation, but a usable framework when describing
our approach. On occasion, we'll depart from that model if and when we
decide to take out a part of the system and rebuild it from scratch. From
painful experience, we'd rather suffer (and cause others to suffer with
us) a temporary inconvenience than to live with our sins forever. In a
way, this sort of effort is a fleeting luxury, one we can afford in the
early days of the system when the concrete hasn't set and we can still
move the foundation walls.
</p><p>
Back to the Game Kit... The second point about the Game Kit concerns
facilitating what programmers will do anyway—with or without our
support or approval. In this case, game developers want and will write
directly to the screen. This epiphany was easier for Pierre than for most
systems programmers: He wrote games that were his calling card when we
hired him. Only later did he also reveal he writes science fiction. Doom
and other best-selling games contravene programming guidelines on systems
such as DOS/Windows that make the breach relatively easy. Frequently,
these games aren't available at all (and therefore don't help sales) on
systems such as the Macintosh, because these systems make such invasions
too difficult. Picking our challenge was easy: We'll take the problems
and the sales. If we do a good job with the Game Kit, we might even
minimize the problems associated with high-speed writing to the screen
without hurting game quality—and sales—too much. In the BeOS, we're
cognizant of the realities of office life: Games take over the screen in
one of the system's workspaces. This helps users avoid the
misunderstandings and lengthy explanations about the relaxing and
reflection-enhancing virtues of games: Switching to a more mundane
workspace is one keypress away. We're of the school that thinks there's
no serious computer without a serious inventory of games. The Game Kit
reflects this philosophy.
</p><p>
The 3-D question calls for more complex answers, and Pierre points to the
difficulty of a "one size fits all" API. Many have suggested we license
OpenGL®, so we're doing that now. I've just executed the licensing
agreement, and we can expect the port to be completed in the near future
(not for DR8, but soon thereafter). The good news is that OpenGL® is a
liked and respected industry standard. Silicon Graphics has done a great
job of promoting it, and as the smoothness of the licensing process
attests, the "Open"in OpenGL® is not there in vain. It will be attractive
for high-end applications, and it represents yet another installment in
our effort to make it easy, or easier at least, for some UNIX
applications to migrate to the BeBox. This effort started when we
realized we could progressively implement a fairly complete Posix API in
the BeOS. We also decided to build a separate 3-D Kit in the BeOS.
Simpler or more interactive 3-D applications are not best served by an
API originally designed for high-end CAD work. The full 3-D Kit isn't
implemented yet, even if the project is fully scoped in Pierre's papers.
Just as many hardware and software developers found color wasn't merely
more bits per pixel, we know 3-D isn't the visual space we know, with
just one more dimension. Success will stem in great part from our fine
tuning of the architectural choices we've made and, for this, developer
feedback is even more important than usual. The first public
demonstrations will take place at the Boston MacWorld Expo in August. We
hope to see you there or soon thereafter.

More opinions on the shutdown mechanism, plus a new proposal: The
interface (probably some designated portion of the Browser) should
indicate whether it's safe to turn the computer off. This was countered
with the position that the computer can't really know for sure if it's
safe—you have to perform an explicit sync between the file system
and the database.

In this thread (which finally separated itself from "Speaking of
PostScript...") the previously proposed system-level data translation
mechanism was critiqued. As an alternative, EAIFF 85 (Electronic Arts
Interchange File Format) was suggested. And rebutted.

This has turned into a mail filter/type discussion. Should Be create a

</h5></div></div></div><p>
In the hottest thread of the week, the philosophy of what goes into the
root directory was discussed. Should "/" contain the expected UNIX-like
directories (/dev, /tmp, etc.)? Should a CLI view of the file system be
any different from that presented by the Browser; specifically, what
should the Browser present as "/"?
</p><p>
Woven into the thread was a debate on how partitions/volumes should be
handled: Should mount point locations be restricted? How should the
BeOS handle a request to eject a mounted (removable) disk?
</p><p>
Also: Will Be do links? Multi-user? Automount?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Remember, the file system rewrite is coming. As far as the
design details go, we'll keep you posted. Until then, this thread is
being closely watched—your suggestions and observations aren't
wasted.

How do you get the ref for the current working directory? The doc for
<code class="function">get_ref_for_path()</code> claims that it doesn't accept relative paths; some
have experienced otherwise.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: The doc is (philosophically, at least) correct: You
shouldn't pass a relative pathname to <code class="function">get_ref_for_path()</code>. This is
because the meaning of cwd in the ref/database world is undefined
(note, however, that this issue is in the file system rewrite hopper).
If you want to pass args, use <code class="classname">BApplication</code>'s
<code class="methodname">ArgvReceived()</code>.
