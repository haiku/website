After you've spent a few years creating a new platform behind closed
doors, huddled like mad scientists, it's possible to lose perspective.
That disappears quickly when you ship a few hundred machines out to
developers who simply want to develop on a great machine. They start to
pick it
apart like crazed weasels, and I mean that in only the most positive
sense. The last few months of supporting the pioneer Be developers has
been very interesting.
</p><p>
The C++ language is one subject that comes up quite a bit. Some
developers love the fact that we've decided to use this language
standard. Others appreciate that we have avoided the language's more
"esoteric" features (multiple inheritance is frequently mentioned here).
Still others (actually only one or two) have said that although they love
the BeBox and its kits, they just can't program it because C++ nauseates
them. A visceral reaction to semantics!
</p><p>
Admittedly, there is a certain amount of religion in these positions, but
one thing is true: C++ is not known for its dynamism. Between static
binding, the base class feature, virtual tables, and no garbage
collection, C++ is a bit of a stubborn old aunt who refuses to leave the
house. For us, this presents some problems and challenges, but ones which
I think can be managed if we all modify our mindset a bit.
</p><p>
With the older platforms whose limitations we are trying to overcome,
software (both application and system) has been a very static thing. It
takes about four years for Microsoft and Apple to develop and publish a
new release. Application software is then stuck on floppies or CDs which
spend an average of nine months in the distribution channel. If we are
going to be able to continue to outrun those platforms, we need to have a
much more flexible attitude about software
updates and distribution.
</p><p>
Such flexibility in thinking will help us together overcome some of the
static limitations of C++ without locking ourselves into an API, virtual
table layout etc., for all time. But it's not just to make dealing with
C++ easier that I recommend this, it will be better for our customers as
well. They ask you for new features in your application, you in turn ask
for new system software features to facilitate them, we implement them,
perhaps shifting around a class layout. We ship you the new version of
BeOS, you implement the new features, we ship the new software together,
and the customer buys the upgraded application from you and thinks you're
the most responsive application developer they've ever seen.
</p><p>
So how often can we do this? Every four months may be a bit too
frequent—but it will certainly be much more often than once every four
years. The improved communication and distribution mechanisms afforded by
the Internet will help us show ourselves to be much more responsive than
the older platforms.

“<span class="quote">The BeBox will shine in multimedia,</span>” says Tom Ierna, president of AMP
Productions, Inc. Based in Florida, his 5-person company specializes in
35mm slide presentations, video, computer-based kiosks, and live
entertainment, serving the education and business markets. When four
thousand members of local student clubs convened in Florida, AMP was
there shooting slides and video, which they edited on-site to produce and
deliver a show on the last day—much like a slide show on the last day
of summer camp.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Customers today want integrated video, computer graphics, MIDI, and
digital sound effects in their slide shows,</span>” says Ierna. “<span class="quote">The cost of the
hardware, software, and expertise to produce that kind of presentation is
phenomenal: a 15-20 minute show can cost up to $30,000. You almost want
to ask customers to hand over their checkbooks!</span>”
</p><p>
As a small company, AMP is always on the lookout for ways to make their
multimedia productions easier, faster, and less expensive. And that's
exactly why the BeBox caught their eye. “<span class="quote">Out-of-the-box hardware extras
are what made us choose the BeBox,</span>” Ierna says. Especially the MIDI and
GeekPort capabilities, but also the PCI bus architecture, the CD-quality
stereo sound, and the slew of expansion and connection options. “<span class="quote">With the
BeBox, we feel like we're working on the cutting
edge instead of on the 10- to 20-year old technology that most of today's
high-volume computers are based on.</span>”
</p><p>
AMP has both short-term and long-term plans for the BeBox. Short-term,
they'll use their Be application internally to produce the slide
presentations, with the <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™ GUI replacing their command line-driven
programming language (which has been adopted as the industry standard).
“<span class="quote">We'll also use our application to control the slide shows: the slide
projectors will be controlled by the BeBox (most likely through the
GeekPort), our audio will be generated on the BeBox, and we'll use a
control signal from the BeBox to sync the video.</span>” Long term, they hope to
see digital video editing and output on the box, providing a truly
integrated solution.
</p><p>
Ierna doesn't think it will take much to attract multimedia developers to
the Be platform. “<span class="quote">Mention true multiprocessing, true multitasking,
multithreading, the expansion and connection options that the box
provides, and they'll froth at the mouth.</span>”
</p><p>
AMP expects to release their Be application in early 1997. For more

This week we lost a big man, David Packard, one of the Founding Fathers
of Silicon Valley. The mourning has less an air of sadness than one of
celebration for we are remembering an accomplished life. There isn't much
I can add to the well-deserved tributes to his business and
philanthropic achievements. "The HP Way," a charmingly unassuming book,
details the philosophy behind the business "Bill and Dave" built,perhaps
the most enduringly successful company in our industry, good to its
shareholders, customers and employees. I know, I worked there.
</p><p>
Twenty-eight years ago this coming June, Hewlett-Packard offered me what
proved to be the opportunity of a lifetime. At age 24, I was coming out
of what is tolerantly referred to in California as my psycho-social
moratorium. Meaning my business experience consisted of a string of
disconnected jobs—descriptions of some would be out of place in this
family publication—in the food, beverage and entertainment,
pharmaceuticals and insurance fields. I had no idea what a resume was.
So, when I saw the recruitment ad specifying a math or physics degree,
selling experience and fluent English, I wrote a two-page letter
explaining why they should hire me. They did, in spite of my broken
English. My job was to launch their first desktop computer in the French
market.
</p><p>
Looking back, I shudder sometimes. Placed today in their situation, would
I hire myself? Joining Hewlett-Packard was a revelation. I came from a
culture of distrust and hostility between management and workers. At HP I
grew in an environment where I was trusted, given a degree of freedom and
responsibility I had not encountered elsewhere, and found an incredible
patience with my combination of inexperience and strongly held views. I
flourished and rose in the hierarchy as HP became king of the hill in the
desktop computer business, before it missed the early phase of the PC
revolution.
</p><p>
To this day I'm indebted to HP for its kind of schooling. It was so
convincing I came to think every US company conducted their business in
the same humane and efficient way. I was brought back to reality when I
joined another school—of hard knocks this time—at a very East Coast
minicomputer company. A few years later I got an opportunity to practice
both kinds of schooling when I started Apple France. Our office was
across the street from HP so I could hire a few good men from the old
company without disturbing their commute. We did well and, in obeisance
to the Peter Principle, I was transferred to this country and promoted to
a job for which I had no experience or formal training.
</p><p>
After another five years of schooling in the ways of Corporate America, I
started Be. The HP connection helped in small and big ways: When HP's
credit department was unwilling to ship a logic analyzer to Steve
Sakoman's garage—a small but frustrating problem—John Young's (HP's
CEO at the time) secretary quickly cleared the path. The Big Problem was
fund raising. When we started Be, our idea looked even crazier than it
does today. Windows and Mac reigned supreme, investors in NeXT and
Momenta had been burned and Go didn't look great either. Kleber
Beauvillain, CEO of HP France and an early Be investor with other HP
Europe luminaries, made the introduction to Credit Lyonnais. Their
venture arm, Innolion, became the lead investor in our first round. The
company would have probably never gotten off the ground without that
connection at a time when most US venture funds (with one exception,
Newtek) found the idea too risky—or "too interesting" as the dreadful
euphemism became familiar to us.
</p><p>
As we make the transition from a group developing a product to a real
company, one with developers, business partners, and customers, I too
mourn the passing of a great man. I do it with admiration for a life well
lived, with gratitude for the opportunities and the schooling, and with
the hope I'll honor my debt in building this business.
