As developers, you're probably aware that BeOS is a layered system. The
kernel is at the bottom with its drivers and modules, followed by a few
libraries (root, net, textencoding), various servers (app, input,
registrar, net), a few more libraries (be, netdev, tracker) and finally,
applications. The whole collection makes a wonderfully synergistic
system. But just how much of that stack do you really need?
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id465857"></a>It <span class="trademark">Depends</span>™</h3></div></div></div><p>
What do you want to do? Occasionally, a demo coder thread erupts on
BeDevTalk. Invariably, someone laments about the overhead of this or that
feature of the OS. Without commenting on the relative merits of these
discussions, I can tell you how to get as close to the silicon as you can
without writing your own drivers. But to do that, we have to decide what
we don't need.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id465877"></a><acronym class="acronym" title="Rest In Peace">R.I.P.</acronym> app_server</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you want to get close to the hardware, you've got to go around the
app_server. Or better yet, not run it at all. Once you take this step,
every other server in the OS is useless, so they can go too. Because
networking runs as a server (at least until <acronym class="acronym">BONE</acronym> shows up), networking is
right out. No servers means no <code class="filename">libbe.so</code> and friends. Just about the only
thing left is <code class="filename">libroot.so</code>, but that's quite a bit. You still have just
about all the <acronym class="acronym">POSIX</acronym> we support, plus access to BeOS-specific features,
such as loading add-ons and creating semaphores. This means any class of
driver for which you know the <code class="function">ioctl()</code> API is still usable. We'll get back
to this in a bit.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id430893"></a>Booting BeOS</h3></div></div></div><p>
By systematic trial and error, you'd find that you need very few files to
boot BeOS. I'll save you some time and tell you what you need for the
loader to boot to a particular partition. You'll definitely need the
kernel (and <code class="filename">zbeos</code> on x86 hardware), and whatever drivers/busses/modules
support your particular hardware. You'll need the accelerant for your
graphics card(s). And you'll need two other files: <code class="filename">/boot/beos/bin/sh</code> and
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/boot/Bootscript</code>. Bootscript can be empty, but it must
exist. <code class="filename">sh</code> is the program the OS executes to get things started. BASH is
nice, as shells go, but not needed for this operation, so I decided to
replace it with my application. For getting started, you can just replace
sh with your own app, but for grins I removed (almost) everything that
wasn't required for my particular hardware. 'du -k /test/beos' reports a
measly 2493K.

NOTE: I Am Not A Demo Coder. Besides, this was not really an exercise of
my demo coding skills. I'm just the point man, and I've discovered these
two tips/traps:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
To aid debugging, you'd like to keep a log file (and/or generate
serial debug output). Calling <code class="code">freopen("/boot/var/log/demo.out", "w",
stdout)</code> is useful in this respect. You can do what you like with the
other standard file handles. In my program I get <code class="filename">stdin</code> from <code class="filename">/dev/null</code>
and <code class="code"><code class="function">freopen</code>("/boot/var/log/demo.err", "w", <code class="varname">stderr</code>)</code> in case something I
load as an add-on uses it. You can also call <code class="code"><code class="function">disable_debugger</code>(1)</code> and
arrange for your app to get all the signals itself, but I don't do that
in the demo.
</p></li><li><p>
Set the <code class="envar">ADDON_PATH</code> and <code class="envar">LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variables. If you
don't, <code class="function">load_add_on()</code> will fail—even if you specify a full path to
the add-on.
</p></li></ul><p>
The meager demo application can be found at:
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/graphics/SlimDemo.zip&gt;
</p><p>
If you've ever looked into the test harness shipped in the R4 Graphic
Driver Kit, chunks of the sample code would be eerily familiar.
Programming at this level is fairly unexciting, and this code is no
exception. The <code class="function">main()</code> function initializes the standard file descriptors
and environment variables mentioned above, and then spawns and waits on a
thread to handle the display chores.
</p><p>
The spawned thread hunts down and opens a graphics device, and then
attempts to load the corresponding accelerant (R4 graphics drivers are
two-part beasts, as is common under BeOS). After the accelerant is
loaded, the code sets the first reported display mode and then begins the
cheesy (and short) "animation." I didn't bother to set up and use
hardware acceleration, but it's easy to do, and the harness program in
the driver kit will show you the way. When the animation finishes, the
accelerant is uninitialized and unloaded, and the device is closed. The
thread terminates, and shortly thereafter so does the application,
leaving the kernel silently in charge of the machine.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id431029"></a>B_DONT_DO_THAT</h3></div></div></div><p>
A friendly <acronym class="acronym" title="Developer Technical Support">DTS</acronym>
staff member pointed out that while you can run the sample
code while the full BeOS is running, you won't like the results. The
current driver model doesn't do anything in the way of preventing you
from opening and initializing the graphics device if it's already
running. If you have specific combinations of graphics cards in your
machine (and a <acronym class="acronym" title="Basic Input/Output System">BIOS</acronym>
that isn't broken, but that's another story), you can
open and control the other graphics card(s). You might also consider not
replacing <code class="filename">/boot/beos/bin/sh</code> on your primary boot partition, but rather
making yourself a tiny test partition to play with. Caveat Programmer.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id430692"></a>Now What?</h3></div></div></div><p>
That's pretty much up to you. Access to other devices is mostly a matter
of issuing the right <code class="function">ioctl()</code> calls. If you can't find them documented in
the BeBook, in headers, or in some newsletter article, e-mail me. One of
you d00dz write a l33t dem0, and show me just how lame my example really
is.
