Because we know that our success grows directly from your success, we
want to support your efforts to develop for BeOS and BeIA, and we're
constantly thinking about and working toward ways to improve this
support. The past few months have given us all an opportunity to think
hard about what we're doing and how to serve the customers we want to
attract, while the computing market continues to evolve around us.
</p><p>
To keep pace with the exciting changes in our business and increase the
number and kind of our development partners, Be has made some changes in
our developer services that should make it easier for all Be developers
to market successful products. We'd like to tell you about our new
support options (which include better access to materials at no charge)
and help you understand how you may be able to capitalize on changes in
the computing market and develop for either BeOS or BeIA, or both, in the
new millennium.
</p><p>
Just in the past few months Be has announced strategic Internet appliance
relationships with partners such as Compaq, National Semiconductor, Intel
Corporation, First International Computer, Inc. and Proxim, Inc. With our
partner list growing this fast, you can imagine the higher level of
support that Be must provide. Added to the exciting Internet appliance
challenge is the popularity of BeOS 5 Personal Edition (over 870,000
downloads as of last week) and a large number of new BeOS developers
downloading the tools and becoming involved. Thanks to all our developers
for being so patient during this exciting growth.
</p><p>
We are happy to announce that on Wednesday, April 26, Be Inc. is
launching an improved Developer Services section of our web site:
http://www.be.com/developers/. This announcement describes the new
structure of Developer Services, changes to the costs of services, and
what resources are available to all developers at various levels. These
changes were made in order to better serve the Be Developer Community. Be
Inc. and the Be User and Developer Communities value your involvement now
more than ever.
</p><p>
Developer Services is dedicated to fulfilling the needs of developers who
build BeIA information and entertainment appliances as well as those who
develop commercially viable BeOS software. Three levels of participation
are available:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
a Free Developer Resources level
</p></li><li><p>
a BeIA Evaluation Service level, and
</p></li><li><p>
a Partner Program level
</p></li></ul><p>
Via the Developer Area of our web site, BeIA and BeOS developers will
have access to excellent online resources at no charge. These resources
include Be Developer Community discussion lists; BMessage, a Newsletter
for Be developers; BeOS 5 Personal Edition; BeOS development tools; BeOS
sample code written by Be engineers; and Bug Report and Feature Request
submission form access. Our hope and plan is that it will be possible for
a wide range of BeOS developers to create quality BeOS desktop software
using these free online resources. No program membership is required, so
there is no hassle of remembering an ID and password. However, we do
encourage all BeOS developers to complete an online survey so we can
track who is developing BeOS software products. BeIA projects all require
BeIA Developer Kits, and will almost certainly require Developer
Technical Support and other benefits available only to Partner Program
Members, so all BeIA developers are encouraged to try the BeIA Evaluation
Service or apply for the Partner Program.
</p><p>
Developers who would like to investigate BeIA software before applying
for the Be Partner Program are encouraged to purchase the BeIA Evaluation
Service for $95. This service includes one downloadable version of BeIA
Eval and all updates for one year. This BeIA software can be easily
installed in Windows and includes cached web pages that illustrate how an
Information Appliance running BeIA might work. Targeted collateral and
documentation are included which provide pertinent information for
potential BeIA developers. BeIA Evaluation Service customers are welcome
to ask our technical support staff about installation issues, but no
other questions will be answered until the company is accepted into the
Partner Program.
</p><p>
Companies who have funding to develop a BeIA or BeOS project are
encouraged to apply for Be's Partner Program so they can take advantage
of additional services. Be will enthusiastically review applications for
the Partner Program with an eye toward providing the best service to
partners that need it to complete viable, trend-setting products. The
person who completes Be's Qualification Form becomes the main contact for
the company accepted into the Partner Program. Each main contact will
have to sign a Partner Program Agreement as part of the final acceptance
procedure. The main contact may distribute their company's membership ID
and password to 5 employees in their company so they can take advantage
of the services provided in the Partner Area of our web site. The main
contact will be informed when the annual review process begins for their
membership.
</p><p>
Partners receive a high level of support from Be. As part of their
membership benefits, partners have access to targeted BeIA Developer Kits
with appropriate Be software, build tools, sample code, and collateral.
Bugs and feature requests submitted by Partners receive priority
attention. In addition, Partners may purchase BeIA Development Machines
that come with development tools pre-installed. Also, partners may
purchase additional services at a support rate (currently $200 per hour).
For instance, Partners can: have Be test the compatibility of a product
with our software; get Developer Technical Support via an online query
form; ask an engineer for one-on-one help; receive UI design
consultation; have a specific driver or a custom application developed;
and more.

What is the difference between BeOS and BeIA?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
BeOS is an operating system for personal computers. There is a free
and an enhanced version available. For Information and Entertainment
Appliances we offer BeIA, the most compelling software solution designed
for the creation of appliances that deliver information and entertainment
over the web. Incorporating technology from BeOS, BeIA is fully
customizable, offers a comprehensive browser and supports popular
streaming audio and video standards.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id435350"></a><a id="id435353"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
How is developing for BeOS and BeIA different?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
BeIA builds are essentially pared down versions of BeOS designed for
dedicated devices. For instance, a particular Internet appliance might
not require printer drivers, so we would leave those out of the BeIA
build for that device in an effort to make it as compact as possible.
</p><p>
Our goal is to have one source tree for both BeOS and BeIA, so that we
can pull BeIA builds out of the BeOS source tree whenever necessary. This
way, as drivers and other improvements are added because of a particular
BeIA project, BeOS as a whole will improve.
</p><p>
Everything that applies to BeOS applies to BeIA. BeIA runs compiled C/C++
code using the Be APIs. You can start writing your BeIA program on BeOS.
The same code will apply to BeIA devices, although it will take some
extra massaging between compile time and run time. The main difference
will be that BeIA applications will have different interface needs. For
example, the device you are working on may not have a keyboard, so you'll
want to have large buttons that provide all application functionality.
The process for moving the code to a device before running is still being
designed, so keep an eye on the FAQs for more information as it is
available.

How do I sell my program on a BeIA device? Is there a way for me to
contact the device builders to include my program on their hardware?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
There will be; part of what it means to be a Partner in the new
program is that Be works with our Partners on complete solutions, so we
will serve as a resource for software and hardware partners to coordinate
on products. If you are a BeOS Developer who is not enrolled in the
Partner Program, please complete the Developer Survey in the Free
Resources section so we know what BeOS software is being worked on in
case we find a need for something in particular. We also encourage you to
contact the manufacturers directly. This system is evolving, so keep
watching the FAQs and the Developer Services area for further information.

So—this week's fashion is structure, as in structural remedies.
Breaking Microsoft in two: OS; and all the rest—applications,
contents, tools, web services, media, hardware. Structural remedies as
opposed to conduct remedies; that is, imposing new rules of behavior. The
problem with conduct remedies is that they amount to putting a cop behind
each Microsoft employee. So there's really no contest as to the choice of
remedies: structure wins every time.
</p><p>
Let me quickly add that I'm aware conduct remedies are also being
considered, such as shedding light on Windows pricing. A good idea, and
the risk of being in contempt of a settlement would act as a credible
deterrent. But more needs to be done, or clarified. Windows licensing
contains abusive language; that is, abusive in that it conserves or
extends the MS monopoly. Forcing licensees, OEMs such as Compaq or Dell,
to use the Windows boot manager, itself only licensed to load MS
operating systems, effectively prevents factory installation of dual- or
triple-boot systems. As a result, you can buy a system with Windows or a
system with an alternative OS, but not a system with both.
</p><p>
Leaving aside our own BeOS for a (brief) moment, why can't you find a
Windows-Linux dual-boot system on the shelves of the grandees of our
industry? Because of Microsoft's legal tricks. Microsoft can say what
they want regarding their love of the freedom to innovate, but in the
dark recesses of their confidential licensing agreements lies clear
evidence that they want to protect their monopoly. It doesn't require a
cop behind every employee to breach this monopoly; it requires only
provisions and sanctions in a settlement.
</p><p>
Returning to structural remedies, separating the OS from applications
such as Office sounds good. It parallels decisions such as the one
(Carterfone if memory serves) that separates the telephone set from the
telephone line. The telephone network is the platform, the set is the
application. The problem with such a neat line of demarcation is that
software is just that—soft. How do you legally draw a line between the
OS and an application? It's not just a question of whether or not the
browser is in the OS or in the application category. Where do you put
Wordpad? Can you or can't you provide a text editor with the OS? It's
really needed to edit configuration files and the like, or just to make a
little note for oneself, Your Honor. And how do you limit the feature set
for this text editor?
</p><p>
This isn't necessarily a bad thing. You could end up with one company
feverishly adding—sorry, integrating—features into its OS, and
another looking at more than one platform for its applications, as long
as the DOJ looks into the unfair OS licensing agreement tricks played by
the "other" company. The Office platform could even buy Red Hat, or
Compaq—that would be fun.
</p><p>
Of course, there's an important topic we haven't discussed yet. Will
Microsoft, with its browser, manage to control the **ML dialect, the
media standards used on the Web? If the answer is yes, they will have
succeeded in extending their monopoly, broken up or not. I'm puzzled that
we don't hear much about this in public discussions.
</p><p>
One caveat, and one conclusion. As before, what we hear might bear little
relationship to what's actually taking place between teams of lawyers and
the judge. In addition, we haven't heard from the attorneys general for
the states that are also suing Microsoft. This antitrust suit has
provided more than a few surprises in the past 18 months, and the appeals
process might keep it alive for two years or more. In conclusion then,
while there isn't a beautifully clear solution, an uncomplicated
combination of enforceable conduct remedies and breaking up the behemoth
might restore competition and foster innovation in our industry. It might
even benefit Microsoft shareholders if the history of Standard Oil and
AT&amp;T repeats itself.
