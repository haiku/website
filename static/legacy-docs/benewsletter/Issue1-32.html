The other day a deputy from the Santa Clara county sheriff's office
called and offered to let me help pay for their effort to keep kids off
drugs. A commendable pursuit, to be sure, but I wondered aloud that is it
not in the *development* of a robust drug habit that the expense is
incurred? "Seems to me..." (I continued, making a fool of myself to an
audience that knew my name and had the authority to radically curtail the
freedoms that were granted me by the divinity of my choice) ...it seemed
to me that *not* taking drugs—much like not buying a plane, not
undergoing elective cosmetic surgery, and not travelling across Europe
for a year and a half—is a leisure activity that actually makes very
little demand on one's disposable income (or the county's coffers). Had
he asked me to help buy Johnny some crack—now *that* would make sense.
</p><p>
I didn't take the deputy's unresponsiveness as an indication that he was
necessarily unconvinced by my confutation; actually, I think he couldn't
hear me—there was a lot of noise in the background. It sounded like
the hubbub of kids not taking drugs. So I made a suggestion to him that
was presented to me in simile many years ago and miles away in the Sunday
School of a church that has since burned down:
</p><p>
If you're talking on the phone in such a noisy room that you can't hear
your correspondent, don't stick a finger from your free hand into your
free ear in an attempt to hear better. Instead, cover the mouthpiece
while listening, uncovering it only to speak.
</p><p>
(The moral side of the simile, easy enough to conjecture from this
description, was something along the lines of, "If you want to hear what
God has to say, shut up." Frankly, I wasn't all that keen on the ex
cathedra angle, but the phone trick itself I have kept with me to this
day. The burned down church was called First Federated. It sounded like a
bank: "First Federated, where Jesus Saves.")
</p><p>
This method of "room noise rejection" works incredibly well; the shocking
thing is that very few people know about it. Less shocking (or more, as
we shall see) is how it works. First, the biology:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The brain is divided into two halves, left and right (or back and
front if you're standing sideways).
</p></li><li><p>
The brain works by firing teeny electrical charges across the
synaptic gap between adjacent neurons.
</p></li><li><p>
Thus, your head is—almost literally—a battery with two
chambers, just like in your car. (Except a car battery has more
chambers. That's because your car is smarter than you.)
</p></li></ul><p>
What happens when your car battery starts to run down? You pour water
into the little chambers; the higher the water level, the more
electricity the battery can generate. If it runs dry, it loses its
charge. In biology, we call people who've lost their brain water
"airheads."
</p><p>
Back to the phone trick: When you stick your finger in your ear, you
temporarily increase the water level on one side of your brain—but
it's the wrong side. Furthermore, while the heightened level actually
does improve your ability to hear, this increase in acuity is tempered by
the fact that, well, you've got a finger in your ear.
</p><p>
Alternatively, by covering the mouthpiece you don't get any smarter, but
you do reduce the amount of ambient noise that's picked up by the
transducer. Remember: Anything that goes into the mouthpiece ends up in
your ear (please don't quote this out of context). By shutting the room
noise out of the mouthpiece, you improve the listening environment for
your phone ear. The other ear is still assaulted, but your brain is
marvelously adept at listening to one ear while almost completely
ignoring the other, with slight personal variations due to age, sex, and
whether you live in Santa Clara.
</p><p>
If you want to perform further experiments on your brain you can use the
<span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™. In Developer Release 8 of the BeOS, we will introduce new
classes that let you access the GeekPort's eight channels of
analog-to-digital and digital- to-analog conversion (four channels each
way) and the two digital data ports. The classes, which are part of the
Device Kit, are called BA2D, BD2A, and BDigitalPort. The methodology (and
API) for objects of these classes is quite simple: You open a specific
channel or port, sit in a loop that reads (or writes) a series of values
(one access per device per loop turn), and then, when you're through, you
close the object.
</p><p>
It's fast, simple, and inexpensive. Of course, if you want customized
documentation (with your name and those of your children worked into the
code examples), you may have to pay a bit more. You see, I'm thinking of
not taking a mistress and not keeping her in a pied-a-terre overlooking
San Marino, which I would then not visit a couple of times a month. I'm
not sure how much it's going to cost to keep myself from doing it, but
the meter is running.

I started my company, The Serial Port, in 1988 to sell my first
communications package, ARCterm 6. This was one of the first such
packages for the Acorn machine. It had all the usual things: x/y/zmodem,
scripting, vt100/ansi/viewdata (videotex), and so on. Although it never
caught on in America, the Acorn machine is used all over Europe (and
beyond). It's mostly for educators and enthusiasts, so the market isn't
big, but it's devoted, and for a software developer that isn't in it just
for the money, the size is nearly ideal—it's large enough to support a
small company, but still small enough that an individual developer can
change the way the machine is used.
</p><p>
In developing for the Acorn I've seen ARCterm and my other products --
terminal-emulation and file-transfer packages, telnet and rlogin clients,
fast serial cards—used in universities from Germany to New Zealand.
They've even found their ways into companies such as Sony, Eidos, and
others. Nowadays, I just develop products that other companies (currently
ANT Ltd. and Atomwide Ltd.) resell.
</p><p>
I was delighted when I heard about Be. This is a concept that took some
nerve, going out on a limb and making a dream machine—companies ruled
by accountants don't do that. Technically, the machine is nearly perfect
for communications applications; it's a multiprocessor machine with
oodles of I/O. And it supports a familiar programming environment:
Metrowerks' IDE and the bash shell—in other words, both GUI and the
command line!
</p><p>
I've only had my BeBox for a short time, but hopefully a beta version of
my ANTterm will be out soon. The actual terminal works fine, but the
dialogs are far from pretty. As soon as a UI-building tool appears for
the BeBox...
</p><p>
As soon as I have time, I plan on putting in some serious play time on
the BeBox. Then I'll see what's needed and, with luck, help move the
machine into markets that I'm familiar with.

"Bundling" is one of the most emotive words in the computer business.
During what passes for my career, I've seen grown men, and even a few
grown women, reduced to incoherent anger by the topic, and I've witnessed
a CEO become so impassioned by the subject that he climbed onto a
conference room table to be able to better shake his finger in somebody's
face (mine). Fortunately, Be's fearless CEO is not prone to
table-climbing (at least not yet), so we can have rational discussions
about bundling.
</p><p>
There are two aspects to bundling: Software and hardware. I'll cover
software in my next mutterings (thus relieving me of the agony of
deciding what to write about in two weeks' time). Software bundling is
even more emotive than hardware, so let's work up to it gradually.
</p><p>
Bundling is a popular technique because it allows a vendor to combine
high- and low-margin products into a package in which it's very hard for
the customer to determine how much he or she is paying for each
component. When bundling is coupled with manufacturers' dire warnings of
the consequences of using "unapproved" third-party components, resulting
in voided warranties, the customer may justifiably feel manipulated and,
worse, ripped off. The bad old days of paying five times the market price
for, say, a disk drive or a memory board in order to obtain the
manufacturer's seal of approval are (almost) over, but bundling continues
to be a common industry practice.
</p><p>
The strongest theme at Be is "break with the past"; this theme extends
beyond writing a new o/s and creating a new desktop platform, into
business models. We offer our hardware as unbundled as we can make it:
Developers, and soon end-users, can buy BeBoxes with no peripherals at
all. We offer only two configurations today: Bare bones and fully
configured. Although we plan to add a small number of memory and disk
size variations later this year, we're trying to avoid, for now, multiple
disk/memory/CD/graphics/networking permutations because they make
manufacturing and logistics complicated, which translates into higher
costs and higher prices. In unbundling our hardware this way, our
customers can easily figure out how much profit we're trying to make on
memory, disks, and other peripherals. The answer, not surprisingly, is
very little. The result has been that most of our customers to date have
ordered fully configured machines.
</p><p>
A paradox, perhaps? By unbundling hardware we have created a situation
where most people prefer the bundled solution. I prefer to think of it as
freedom of choice at work. The hardware unbundling scheme seems to be
working fine for us and for our customers. An additional observation is
that we have observed few, if any, problems resulting from customers
configuring their machines with parts that they've obtained on the open
market. Whether this is because of tolerant hardware design on our part
or increasing standardization and quality of widely available components
is irrelevant. The point is that it works just fine.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee1-32"></a>The A behind the V</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
The V of DVD, that is. For us at Be, DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) holds
much promise. As it breaks strangleholds and suggests new applications,
it represents a good vehicle for a new entrant such as ourselves. As
usual, glowing predictions are made for the new medium and, as usual, the
grand new applications will need more time than expected. Still,
technical difficulties and confusion over standards notwithstanding, the
promise of 8 or 16 times the capacity of today's CDs backed by the best
high-tech and entertainment conglomerates in the world is guaranteed to
succeed. Most of the salivating is over video applications—a movie on
a CD. The stamping cost is less than duplicating a tape, the format is
more convenient, pirating is difficult, and it sells new consumer
electronics devices. Life is good. (Or will be—the manna hasn't fallen
from the heavens yet.)
</p><p>
If DVD is a vehicle for Be, on what bahn will we do our driving?
Shovelware, sometimes politely referred to as "repurposing," holds little
opportunity for us. We've seen it on CD-ROM, we'll see it on DVD as well.
We're more interested in two arenas: Games and audio.
</p><p>
Ask fanatical MYST players if they'd like richer imagery and plot. Ask
Sony and Sega if they'd like to take a nice bite out of Nintendo's
business. Nintendo has made a "courageous" (some say imprudent) bet on
cartridges. Sony and Sega might use DVD in versions of their game
consoles as a way to further the momentum they've gained as the
cartridge-based Nintendo Ultra 64 is delayed. We already intend to
cultivate game-authoring applications, a genre our product serves well.
DVD, when it becomes a game medium, will make the opportunity better as
it will demand more bandwidth and better programming tools.
</p><p>
And then there's audio. Somehow CDs failed to deliver the promised
nirvana of audio. Far from a fixative, the crisp clean CD experience
generated a whole audiophile industry bent on fixing the aural
blasphemies of digital sound. And so we had hilarious discussions of the
audio artifacts of cables, oxygen-free copper, and propagation-enhancing
crystalline microstructure for better resolution. Or the mellower sound
of tubes, with a Chino-based company, Vacuum Tube Logic, charging a
premium for esoteric triode-tetrode switching.
</p><p>
Behind this excess there's opportunity: Higher resolution and multitrack
sound. Today's home theater sound is simply tarted-up stereo using
decades-old gimmicks that extract spatial information that's fed to a
third, a fourth, or even a fifth speaker. Higher resolution (20-bit)
sound will make the discerning listener happy (or at least happier).
Three (or more) real, independent audio channels will yield novel sound
experiences in movies and concerts. Of course we'll have to sit through
the "mind blowing" dog and pony demos at first, but just as with stereo
40 years ago, the gimmicks will yield to comfortable and intelligent
uses, and the phenomena will stabilize to become a fact of life in homes
and cars.
</p><p>
Audio applications are already friendly to the BeBox. Higher resolution
and more channels will help us differentiate ourselves against aging
platforms. Demand won't be small: Video may stand at the forefront of the
new medium, but we spend more time listening to music than watching
videos.
</p><p>
A final word of caution: These new audio applications won't be settled in
the next 18 months. In the meantime, we'll happily help make music for
today's CDs, with or without vacuum tubes and monster cables.

Most of the old threads died last week, probably because nobody did
anything except post to the "App names" and "First experiences" threads.
An astonishing amount of mail passed through these two threads in the
last ten days or so. To subscribe to BeDevTalk, visit the mailing list

This thread came back last week to flirt with the subject of
drag-and-drop. It was contended that Be's d'n'd facility could be
better; for example, the source (app) for a drag isn't informed where
the dragged icon was dropped.

Strategies for installing and uninstalling apps that bring a multitude
of collateral files. Should the dispersal of such files be limited?
Should there be an Amiga-like "Assign" approach (in which an
application modifies system variables in order to tell the system where
its resources are)?
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id491199"></a>Subject: App names</h4></div></div></div><p>
The "App names" thread began with a simple and seemingly innocuous
question: What are the four-byte application signatures for? The quick
and easy answer (so apps can be identified—in order to receive
messages, for example—by the Browser and other apps) raised some new
questions (and unburied a number of gnawed-on tibiae):
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Is the type/creator identification "good" enough? It's
numerically sufficient, but should it be human readable? Should Be
use MIME types instead?
</p></li><li><p>
Should there be an explicit versioning system?
</p></li><li><p>
Given an imported file, how should its type be determined? Should
the user have to drag the icon onto an app in order to set the
creator info?
</p></li><li><p>
Given an existing recognized file, should there be tools for
setting the application that will open it by default? Should the user
be able to specify an alternate opener? Should these tools be part of
the Browser? Preferences?
</p></li></ul><p>
Everyone seems to have a strongly held opinion, here. Some people have
two or three conflicting opinions, no less strongly held for that.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id491254"></a>Subject: First experiences</h4></div></div></div><p>
Second only to the "App names" thread in volume of participants, this
thread wasn't about how to use the box, but how to turn it off.
Specifically, should Be provide ephemeral disk synchronization and
database integrity assurance in order to obviate the "shut down"
process, and would this make everything else slower? Horizontally,
should the user be prompted to save "dirty" files, or should, perhaps,
the unsaved data be stored and retrieved at the next session?
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id491273"></a>Subject: Speaking of PostScript...</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">A/K/A: File Format</h5></div></div></div><p>
Document-type identification and translation. It was suggested that Be
provide a system-level data translation mechanism. This way, if you
receive data (in e-mail, for example) that has a recognized type, but
for which you don't have a reader, you can ask the system to translate
the data into a type that you can read.

Why should anyone choose Be over WinNT 4.0? A number of flattering
reasons.
