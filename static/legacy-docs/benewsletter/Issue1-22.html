The last time I wrote (issue 9, February 7, 1996 ), I discussed the first
part of the design process—the part that gets you 90% of the way
there. Now let's finish the job and build some systems.
</p><p>
We built only three prototypes of our first board (Rev 01). This was, in
essence, a "learning board," so it was good to start small. We learned
several things about overlapped transfers on the processor bus, and found
mistakes in the placement and pinouts of the board's components. But
these boards served us well as we tested the CPU and RAM, the disk
systems, and the devices on the PCI and ISA busses. To arbitrate
communication between these different appendages, you need a controller;
luckily, we received our first controller chips (the MPC105 "Eagle") the
same day that we got the Rev 01 prototypes back from the fabricator.
</p><p>
I designed the PCB of the I/O card while the software team started using
the Rev 01 boards. The I/O card was a difficult design: It fit on 4
layers with lots of EMI features on the inner planes. The component
density was higher than the motherboard, especially around the
<span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™.
</p><p>
Rev 02 of the motherboard saw about 10 prototypes. We used these boards
to really shake down the I/O cards and the chip sets, and ended up adding
some glue logic in the form of two GALs to solve some problems.
</p><p>
Rev 03 was a build of about 45 boards that went to the engineering team
and a few guinea pigs outside the company. These systems incorporated the
glue logic and are quite similar to what you are seeing now. The one
major difference is the ISA I/O chip set: With Rev 03, we experienced a
problem with the mouse port, so we replaced the part that contained the
keyboard/mouse, floppy, parallel port, RTC, and serial port with separate
chips. Later, it turned out that the problem probably wasn't in the part
we replaced—but in a bit of perverse luck, that part went on severe
allocation and the price jumped dramatically. Thus, by swapping parts, we
indeed solved a problem—we just didn't realize, at the time, that it
was an economic and not a technological one.
</p><p>
Rev 04 was another short build to test the new I/O solution. To save time
and set-up costs, these boards were hand-built, with the exception of the
BGA, which was soldered to the board in the standard reflow process. A
couple of nits were found and fixed with rework wires. Rev 04 was the
first board to see the new chassis, so new mounting slots and holes were
added, as was the new front panel.
</p><p>
Rev 05 was our first big build—more than 400—and our first general
shipment to developers. If you have a system now it's probably a Rev 05.
The machines were built in-house: Half of our floor space was given over
to a make-shift factory, complete with an ad hoc assembly line. These
systems were shipped in a preproduction chassis without the front panel.
</p><p>
Rev 06 is a build of 450 units that is hitting the streets as we speak.
For the first time we have in-circuit tests in place at the board factory
to locate problems before the boards leave the production line; so far
we've had a 91% first pass yield, the remaining units requiring minor
touch-up to pass. Rev 06 is being shipped in a production chassis with an
LED board and an untextured front panel. This build is (finally!) being
handled by an outside service that's experienced in the business of
assembling, testing, and shipping PC clones.
</p><p>
Enough for this time, except to say that Be is seeking a hardware
engineer to join our team. If you would like to join us, read the job

Eric Berdahl, Mitch Adler, and John Townsend could write a "how-to" book
on new, object-oriented operating systems. That's because they're all
former Taligent employees who jumped ship in January 1996 to form
Shooting Star Systems, a company that develops OEM solutions for
professional video production.
</p><p>
What sort of solutions? Take an evening news broadcast as an example. The
opportunities Shooting Star is looking at include: Editing and sequencing
raw video footage into broadcast-ready clips complete with titles and
graphics; compositing and wiping between a live video feed and a studio
feed within the same news segment; and compositing a weather person on
top of a computer-generated map, so the presenter can appear to
manipulate the map on-screen.
</p><p>
As Eric Berdahl puts it, “<span class="quote">One of the advantages of taking an OEM approach
to these problems is that the customer often doesn't know—and usually
doesn't care—about the name of the computer that's at the heart of the
system. They just want the best solution.</span>” And that's exactly what the
BeBox will help Shooting Star deliver.
</p><p>
Given their pedigree, it isn't surprising that the folks at Shooting Star
are quite familiar with the problems inherent in OS and application
models. Eric observes that “<span class="quote">Be appears to have skirted most of the tar
pits.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">While other developers are worrying about obeying standards and
maintaining market share, Be is one of the few companies that's adopting
a don't-swallow-the-elephant attitude. Be has simple solutions to
difficult problems and isn't trying to solve world hunger with its
offering.</span>”
</p><p>
On the business side, Eric believes the BeBox is an ideal platform for
OEM models. “<span class="quote">With the <span class="trademark">Be OS</span>™, we can develop solutions with a minimum
of interference from the underlying OS and a maximum of support for
general programming problems, such as multitasking and memory management.</span>”
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">We have some very interesting PCI boards available to us for building
video production systems,</span>” says Eric. “<span class="quote">We plan to use these in
conjunction with a PCI chassis and our own custom software.</span>”
</p><p>
Shooting Star is writing BeBox drivers for some of its PCI cards now, and
plans to begin development of its first BeBox product in a month or two.
They expect their product to be available by the end of 1996, but aren't
quite ready to reveal the details yet—so stay tuned.

We get the question on-line, by fax, by phone, and even in person
sometimes when people see the T-shirt. We're very grateful for the
interest and we'd like to respond in the most appropriate and most
durable fashion. Which is to say we'd like to build happy relationships,
create positive word of mouth, not just expedite locally profitable
transactions. There are a number of obstacles on the road to this
blissful state of affairs. Some are regulatory, some are connected to the
status of product development, the availability of applications and more
generally, the resources and learning process involved in building a new
platform.
</p><p>
On the regulatory side, we're in line for FCC approval and expect it
early July. In the meantime, the units coming out of the manufacturing
pipe will continue to be allocated to developers. Even with healthy
caution applied to the size of our backlog of unfilled developer
requests, we'll need the next two months to catch up. Then, FCC approval
in hand, we turn to customers.
</p><p>
As we advertised earlier using various metaphors, this isn't a mainstream
machine. This time, to make the point I'll use the following four
qualifying questions for a prospective customer: Do you own two or more
personal computers already, do you use or love C++, do you have Internet
access, and do you have two thousand dollars on your credit card?
</p><p>
The first question addresses the lack or paucity of applications at the
time we start selling customer units. You must already have personal
computers (we're brand agnostic) to take care of the daily bread and
butter needs the BeBox cannot fulfill. Also, good working knowledge of
the pluses and minuses of existing platforms will add realism to
expectations and enjoyment to ownership of a well-balanced stable of
computers.
</p><p>
Then, the C++ question. I've been advised it's impossible to use AND love
C++. More to the point, for some time, CodeWarrior will be the only—or
one of the very few—applications available on the BeBox. We expect
Java tools to be available from Metrowerks and other sources at a later
date, but in the meantime, our customers have to be interested in C++
programming. CodeWarrior's award-winning IDE and the speed of the BeBox
will add to the enjoyment of C++ programming.
</p><p>
The Internet access shouldn't be a problem. It's almost a self-selecting
mechanism. The Web constitutes our best marketing and support channel. Be
developers will use the Web to promote and distribute their applications
as well. Just as important, even at this very early stage of our life,
there are many active Web sites and substantial traffic on comp.sys.be.
These will grow and provide useful information and technical support to
BeBox users—and Be engineers and marketers. It bears repeating that
without the Internet and the Web, this company probably wouldn't exist.
When I started Be, in October 1990, I thought we'd begin with a small BBS
to interconnect our developers, our users, and ourselves in order to
exchange information, arguments, and software. I even watched with glee
as I saw FirstClass (from SoftArc, a Canadian company), one of the nicest
BBS systems ever, take off and gain worldwide respect for the quality of
their product. I even hoped we could bundle a Be version of FirstClass
with our product, a nice and useful communication tool for early
adopters. The Web has fulfilled that dream and much more, without asking
us to become a BBS operator in order to do business from Australia to
Finland.
</p><p>
As to the credit card question, this is the payment mechanism we've used
thus far. But we'll take any reasonably current and reliable instrument.
And we'll refund your money, as indicated in the small print to come on
the Web site, if you're not happy. Yes, we need money. Happy money, good
word of mouth that brings new customers and repeat business. If we do a
good job processing your images, or serving your web site, we hope you'll
buy more BeBoxes and recommend us to your envious friends.
</p><p>
Initially, we'll offer our products on the Web and run a small number of
experiments with the geekiest of retailers. Even if some of us have prior
experience marketing computers (or because of it), we know this is new
territory. We don't like it when bystanders label us quixotic, when they
are polite, or crazy, when they are honest, for launching a new platform.
We explained and we'll keep explaining how this isn't so lunatic in view
of the state of aging platforms and the emergence of undominated digital
media and communications applications. But they have a point. There's the
expectation that launching a new platform requires almost infinite
Procter &amp; Gamble financial resources. We, in the microbrewery school of
business, plan to deploy the BeBox in the market as we developed it,
patiently. Premature marketing expenditures kill many a start-up. We'll
step up spending only when we have traction, when we have proven where
the BeBox works and where it needs more development. That's what we'll do
in the next few months and we hope you'll lend us a hand by developing
software, buying our product, or just sharing your observations.
</p><p>
A last anecdote. Last week I mentioned selling T-shirts. It looks like
the price just went up. This morning our housekeeper walked in ten feet
tall and handed me a VHS tape. On it there was a segment of David
Letterman's show, prominently featuring Robin Williams, and less
prominently, two glimpses of said housekeeper in the first row proudly
displaying a Be T-shirt. Expect the customary "As Seen on National TV"
label real soon now.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id481914"></a>Be World Tour: New York</h2></div></div></div><p>
Last week, three Beings (Mark Gonzales, Dominic Giampaolo and Alex
Osadzinski) spent three days in New York City taking the BeBox and Be OS
on the road. We did press interviews, radio and TV shows, and three user
group meetings. At every event we demonstrated the BeBox and Be OS and
then had discussions about our company, its strategy, and products.
</p><p>
The press interviews were with The New York Times, Business Week, and
Unigram. The Times and Business Week seemed to really like the demo and
asked a lot of technical as well as business-related questions. This type
of interview will build good relationships with these important journals
for the future and, who knows, may even generate short-term coverage. The
folks from Unigram, an open systems industry weekly newsletter, were
interested to hear about a new system platform, even if it doesn't run
UNIX! Of course, they were most interested in our POSIX compliance, and
seemed pleased that Linux is running on the BeBox.
</p><p>
After the print interviews, we moved on to TV and radio. "High-Tech
Shower" (!), a Japanese-language technology show that can be seen in
Manhattan, asked us to their studios to video tape Mr. Gonzales' demo
performance (he'll be translated into Japanese for the broadcast). Then
we rushed over to WBAI (99.5 FM) for an interview that included a live
phone-in segment. We fielded a lot of very good Be questions—there are
more Be people out there than we'd guessed.
</p><p>
The most important part of the trip was attending and speaking at three
user group meetings: The New York Mac User's Group (NYMUG) and two
meetings sponsored by the Amiga Users' Group (AMUSE). Because of a tight
agenda, we only had time for a quick demo at the NYMUG, although even
that generated a lot of interest. At the two AMUSE meetings we had more
time and enjoyed lively Q&amp;A sessions. After the second meeting, we just
made it out of the building before they locked the doors, and could
easily have spent a couple more hours talking with the Amiga folks.
</p><p>
Altogether, about 400 people saw the BeBox and Be OS during three very
hectic days. Many, many thanks to Bhima Hogan, Livingston Hinckley, Linus
Lys, Eugene Pisman, Chris Bastian and many others in the New York area
who helped us set things up and who hosted us most graciously.
