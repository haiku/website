I really didn't want to write another byte-swapping article. But I had
to. You see, every night I wake up from a recurring nightmare that some
poor BeOS user will be unable to interoperate their BeOS app between
Intel and PowerPC machines. I toss and turn, gripped with worry and
unable to fall back asleep. Then I think of the public flogging the
guilty application writer will get for this terrible deed, and I drift
back into a pleasant slumber.
</p><p>
The truth is that PR2 has some new byte-swapping macros to prepare you
for our Release 3 Intel release and I wanted to tell you about them.
Judicious use of these macros *now* will mean that in most cases your
application will recompile and interoperate when Release 3 rolls around
later.
</p><p>
The new stuff in PR2 is contained in the file
<code class="filename">byteorder.h</code>. The macros can
be summarized as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="function">B_LENDIAN_TO_HOST_XXX</code>()
  convert from little-endian to host format

<code class="function">B_BENDIAN_TO_HOST_XXX</code>()
  convert from big-endian to host format

<code class="function">B_HOST_TO_LENDIAN_XXX</code>()
  convert from host to little-endian format

<code class="function">B_HOST_TO_BENDIAN_XXX</code>()
  convert from host to big-endian format
</pre><p>
Where <code class="literal">XXX</code> equals one of the following types:
<code class="code">INT16</code>, <code class="code">INT32</code>, <code class="code">INT64</code>, <code class="code">FLOAT</code>
or <code class="code">DOUBLE</code>. These macros swap in the case where the host format doesn't
match the desired format (big or little endian), but are no-ops in the
case where the host format matches the desired format.
</p><p>
Additionally, <code class="filename">byteorder.h</code>
contains two identifiers that will tell you the
host endianness:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="constant">B_HOST_IS_LENDIAN</code>
  1 on Intel, 0 on PowerPC

<code class="constant">B_HOST_IS_BENDIAN</code>
  0 on Intel, 1 on PowerPC
</pre><p>
Here is a simple example demonstrating usage of these new macros. If you
read something from a device register (typically little-endian), you
might write some code like this to read the data out into a useful form:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">count</code> = <code class="function">B_LENDIAN_TO_HOST_INT32</code>(<code class="varname">device_registers</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">count</code>)
</pre><p>
On Intel, this macro does nothing, but on PowerPC it will swap the data
for you. It's much easier to read code like this than code that contains
a lot of <code class="code">#ifdef</code>s to deal with byte-order issues. <code class="code">#ifdef</code>s are generally
frowned upon, and you should be ashamed of yourself if you use them.
</p><p>
The following sample program further demonstrates the usage of these new
macros:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;byteorder.h&gt;

</pre><p>
This program reads and writes employee records. The records can be
written on Intel and read by PowerPC or vice-versa. The program is
written in a style I prefer, which is to never swap when writing data, as
long as there is an extra field to indicate the endianness of the data
when written. Then when reading, you swap the data only if necessary. The
advantages of this style are the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
You don't swap when exchanging data between like-minded machines,
like Intel to Intel or PowerPC to PowerPC. This is the common case,
after all.
</p></li><li><p>
The code is easier to understand, because there is only swapping
code for one direction (reading). The write case looks pretty much
like it would if you didn't have to worry about these things (but
unfortunately, you do).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Sometimes you don't have the liberty to define your own data format
because you are dealing with some standard format, such as JPEG or device
registers. The macros will still be helpful to you in this case, and I
recommend using them.
</p><p>
These macros won't solve all of your interoperability problems. You still
need to worry about alignment issues. The employee record in this sample
program was carefully laid out to be interoperable using natural
alignment techniques. Natural alignment is the subject of a previous
Newsletter article...
</p><p>
<a class="xref" href="Issue2-9.html#Engineering2-9" title="Be Engineering Insights: Will Your DATA Look Like ATAD?">Be Engineering Insights: Will Your DATA Look Like ATAD?</a>
</p><p>
...and won't be discussed further here.
</p><p>
So, that's all I have to say. There is now plenty of information
available to you on how to prepare for Intel. If you design your PR2
application right, it is possible to just recompile it for Release
3/Intel and have it interoperate with PowerPC. If you can do this, pour
yourself a drink and enjoy it. You deserve it.

In the short time I've been at Be I've been getting in touch with as many
of our developers as I can. I hear a lot of developers say, "I don't want
to risk doing apps for the BeOS until there are lots of apps out for it."
</p><p>
To address this I have here a somewhat edited version of an e-mail
exchange I had with a developer. (I rewrote it to make me look good.)
Reading this just might make you a million dollars.
</p><p>
ME: Hi, I'm Dave Johnson, new Developer Evangelist at Be, Inc. I'm going
through the database becoming familiar with all the developers, etc.
</p><p>
DEVELOPER: Dave, as much as I love the BeOS, I have to hold off
developing for it until we see Premiere, Photoshop, or After Effects
running on it. Until there are big-name applications I don't think you'll
have the customer base to support my product.
</p><p>
ME: You already know the BeOS is a powerful tool that enables you to
write applications with significantly superior performance—RIGHT NOW
-- so you CAN solve specific problems for specific customers. The fact is
that there are customers out there who want that performance because it
will save them time and money. So for them the argument about whether
there are "enough applications" is irrelevant. Service bureaus, video
editors, graphic design houses don't CARE if Quicken is on the BeOS yet!
They care if you can help them save or make money.
</p><p>
Developers who worry about the size of the existing customer base believe
that you write a generic application and just sort of put it out there
and wait for customers to come to you. In fact this is already happening.
We're doing everything we can to get the BeOS into the hands of lots and
lots of computer users. But there's also another way to look at this
situation.
</p><p>
DEVELOPER: What's that? If you're telling me not to worry about your
existing customer base, how are you proposing I can make money now?
</p><p>
ME: By solving specific problems for specific customers—that's how
people get rich. If you solve one problem in a compelling way for
customers they'll pay you for doing it. Developers who write products
that solve specific problems will do well. The BeOS exists, developers
understand what it's good at, and you're going to see very good products
with vastly superior performance running on it. So why don't YOU do one?
Why don't YOU get there first and establish your specific area of problem
solving? How often do opportunities like that come up?
</p><p>
DEVELOPER: I don't do one, because I really don't want to reinvent the
wheel.
</p><p>
ME: DUDE! Reinventing the wheel on a multi-threaded symmetric
multiprocessing OS means that you'll have something to show that blows
the customers away! You'll either make a mint selling to those customers,
or Adobe will BUY IT from you when they decide it's time to be on the
BeOS. You want to be there first.
</p><p>
DEVELOPER: Well. . .
</p><p>
ME: Name one other OS that gives you superior performance on the same
hardware. Be is going to do well because it is a compelling solution.
Developers know that as soon as they see and use the BeOS. And YOU will
win by writing applications that take advantage of the BeOS's performance
to solve problems for customers.
</p><p>
DEVELOPER: Yes, the BeOS is a compelling solution, and yes, the geeks get
it. But it does no good if the geeks aren't _allowed_ to develop for it.
Adobe isn't going to port until they know that Be's "viable,"
financially. I think you guys are doing a great job, and the BeOS is
coming right along. PR2 is great! The real truth is that you guys have
absolutely no competition. You blow NT out of the water, and make the Mac
OS look like a hack.
</p><p>
BUT I still think your main goal should be getting as many apps, and the
sexiest apps on board. Get Adobe to sign on. No one wants to spend money
on a set of apps that are all 1.0 versions, from tiny three-person
startup companies!
</p><p>
ME: Leading edge developers think that entering an arena where there is
limited competition is a GREAT idea! They see it as a huge opportunity.
How often do you get opportunities like this?
</p><p>
DEVELOPER: But why would a customer buy my product—even one tailored
to solve a specific problem—to run on an OS that he isn't already
using?
</p><p>
ME: Because applications running on the BeOS demonstrate significant
performance improvements that translate into MONEY for the customer.
Visit some of those customers and learn their needs. Take a
multiprocessor computer with you and show a finished app that uses
threaded multiprocessing and does one thing for them in a third of the
time it takes them now. Just ONE thing. You can do that with the BeOS.
Think about all those service bureaus, all the Kinkos, graphic designers,
photo processors, video editors, musicians, you name it...
</p><p>
Time is money, and speeding things up saves money for those businesses.
Lots of businesses are performing some task on a computer that operates
inefficiently. Apps running on the BeOS will outperform apps running on
Mac or Windows or NT. Period.
</p><p>
DEVELOPER: Gosh. I'm glad I listened to you. I AM going to go out and
develop a BeOS application and make a million dollars!
</p><p>
SUMMARY: Hey you developers, listen up, it's opportunity knocking! What
I'm suggesting is that you locate key target business segments and find
out specifically where in their business the benefits of BeOS will make
them money. Find out where they are bogged down by slow programs, which
programs, etc... Then YOU develop a product that takes advantage of the
BeOS to solve that performance problem. Customers will PAY YOU to do
that! The developers that write those applications for those customers
are going to make a lot of money.
</p><p>
Go out there and DO IT.

"Developers' Workshop" is a new weekly feature that provides answers to
our developers' questions. Each week, a Be technical support or
documentation professional will choose a question (or two) sent in by an
actual developer and provide an answer.
</p><p>
We've created a new section on our website. Please send us your
Newsletter topic suggestions by visiting the website at:
http://www.be.com/developers/suggestion_box.html.
</p><p>
So I'm sitting here at my desk, minding my own business and writing
lovely new documentation for the Media Kit, when all of a sudden the
powers that be decide to have the new guy start writing articles for the
Newsletter. After momentarily thinking that was a pretty good joke, I
realize they're actually serious.
</p><p>
As this slowly sinks in, I'm staring at my screen, where pages and pages
of sample code and half-written Media Kit documentation are mocking me.
Slowly it dawns on me that I can impress everyone with my speedy article
writing by ripping out a piece of one of these sample programs I've been
working on and writing an article about it.
</p><p>
After perusing my source code, I realize that what I have in my hands is
nothing less than the answer to the age-old question: "How do I take an
arbitrarily formatted sound and stuff it into that 16-bit stereo sound
stream?"
</p><p>
What I'll present here is a C function that can mix any sound format into
a stream buffer. Ideally, you'll take this code and convert it into a
member function in your sound output class.
</p><p>
The BeOS audio streams (both input and output) are 16-bit stereo. Once
you've subscribed to the output stream (by creating a <code class="classname">BDACStream</code> object
and subscribing to it with a <code class="classname">BSubscriber</code>), you can enter the stream and
start receiving buffers of audio data that you can alter to your heart's
content.
</p><p>
This is great when the sound you want to play is in 16-bit stereo form.
But things get ugly when it's 8-bit mono or some other format. Then you
have to manually fix things like sample size and endianness, and mix the
sound into the stream, preferably without destroying whatever sound is
already in the buffers you receive.
</p><p>
Since you always know what format the output stream is going to be, you
can make your life easier by defining a structure I call standard_frame,
which defines the format of a single frame of audio data in 16-bit stereo
format:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
struct <span class="type">standard_frame</span> {
  <span class="type">int16</span>  <code class="varname">left</code>;    <span class="comment">// Left channel's sample</span>
  <span class="type">int16</span>  <code class="varname">right</code>;    <span class="comment">// Right channel's sample</span>
};
typedef struct <span class="type">standard_frame</span> <code class="varname">standard_frame</code>;
</pre><p>
Now you can create the <code class="methodname">MixStandardFrames()</code> function. It accepts a lot of
parameters. When you add this function to your audio output class, you
can probably eliminate a lot of these parameters by referencing member
variables of your class instead.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="methodname">MixStandardFrames</code>(<span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">soundData</code>, <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">index</code>,
  <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">count</code>, <span class="type">standard_frame *</span><code class="parameter">out</code>, <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">fileFormat</code>,
  <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">byteOrder</code>, <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">sampleSize</code>, <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">channelCount</code>) {
</pre><p>
<code class="parameter">soundData</code> is a pointer to a buffer containing the sound data to mix into
the output buffer. To make your life really easy, it takes a pointer to
the beginning of the complete sound. The <code class="parameter">index</code> parameter is the frame
number of the sound to start playing at. So if you want to play starting
at the 5,000th frame of the sound, you'd pass a pointer to the 0th frame
in <code class="parameter">soundData</code> and the number 5,000 for index.
</p><p>
The <code class="parameter">count</code> parameter is the number of frames
you want to mix, and <code class="parameter">out</code> is a
pointer to a 16-bit stereo sound buffer into which those frames will be
mixed. The remaining parameters specify the file format (<code class="constant">B_WAVE_FILE</code>,
<code class="constant">B_AIFF_FILE</code>, etc), byte order (<code class="constant">B_BIG_ENDIAN</code>
or <code class="constant">B_LITTLE_ENDIAN</code>), sample
size (1 or 2 bytes), and channel count (1 or 2 channels, for mono and
stereo). These parameters allow <code class="methodname">MixStandardFrames</code> to interpret the
incoming data correctly.
</p><p>
<code class="methodname">MixStandardFrames</code> has lots of local variables.
The <code class="varname">shortIn</code>, <code class="varname">byteIn</code>, and
<code class="varname">ubyteIn</code> pointers will be used for type-casted pointers to the sound data.
The other parameters are used, as you'll see later, by the code that does
the actual mixing of the sound data.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">

The first thing to do is verify that the input pointers aren't null. That
would be a bad thing, and as good programmers we fear bad things, so
check for that straight off.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
if (!<code class="parameter">soundData</code> || !<code class="parameter">out</code>) {
  return <code class="constant">B_ERROR</code>;
}
</pre><p>
Then set the stereo variable to 1 if the sound you're playing is in
stereo format, or 0 if the sound is mono. This will be used as a
multiplier as you make your way through the input sound data.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
if (<code class="parameter">channelCount</code> == 1) {
  <code class="varname">stereo</code> = 0;
}
else {
  <code class="varname">stereo</code> = 1;
}
</pre><p>
Now it's time to prepare for the real work. Set up byte, unsigned byte,
and short pointers to the first frame of the sound data to be played.
When you actually start processing the data, you'll use the pointer
appropriate to the type of input data you have. The pointer is cast to
the appropriate type and you add the offset to the specified first frame.
</p><p>
The offset is either <code class="parameter">index</code> or <code class="parameter">index</code>*2,
depending on whether or not the
sound is stereo or not. So you multiply index by <code class="varname">stereo</code>+1, which will
either be <code class="parameter">index</code>*1 or <code class="parameter">index</code>*2.
The result is a pointer to the first frame
to be processed.
</p><p>
Then you initialize the <code class="varname">frame</code> counter to zero.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">byteIn</code> = ((<span class="type">char *</span>) <code class="parameter">soundData</code>)+(<code class="parameter">index</code>*(<code class="varname">stereo</code>+1));
<code class="varname">ubyteIn</code> = ((<span class="type">uchar *</span>) <code class="parameter">soundData</code>)+(<code class="parameter">index</code>*(<code class="varname">stereo</code>+1));
<code class="varname">shortIn</code> = ((<span class="type">short *</span>) <code class="parameter">soundData</code>)+(<code class="parameter">index</code>*(<code class="varname">stereo</code>+1));

                <span class="comment">// (a very good place to start)</span>
</pre><p>
Now it's time to process the actual sound. Start by dealing with 8-bit
sounds, which have a sample size of one byte. Loop through each frame,
from 0 to <code class="varname">count</code>, using the <code class="varname">frame</code> variable as a counter.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
if (<code class="parameter">sampleSize</code> == 1) {
  while (<code class="varname">frame</code> &lt; <code class="parameter">count</code>) {

        (*<code class="varname">ubyteIn</code> - 128) &lt;&lt; 8;
      <code class="varname">ubyteIn</code>++;
    }
    else {
      <code class="varname">sample0</code> = <code class="parameter">out</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">left</code> + (<span class="type">int32</span>) (<span class="type">int8</span>) (*<code class="varname">byteIn</code>) &lt;&lt; 8;
      <code class="varname">byteIn</code> += <code class="varname">stereo</code>;
      <code class="varname">sample1</code> = <code class="parameter">out</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">right</code> + (<span class="type">int32</span>) (<span class="type">int8</span>) (*<code class="varname">byteIn</code>) &lt;&lt; 8;
      <code class="varname">byteIn</code>++;
    }
</pre><p>
The above code computes one frame of mixed sound data. Note that 8-bit
WAVE files get special treatment. That's because 8-bit WAVE format
samples are unsigned, rather than signed. So you have to convert the data
into signed format by subtracting 128 from the samples.
</p><p>
<code class="varname">sample0</code> is the left channel's sample. Grab the next sample from the
buffer containing the sound you're playing (pointed to by either <code class="varname">ubyteIn</code>
or <code class="varname">byteIn</code>), shift it left eight bits to convert it into a 16-bit number,
and add it to <code class="parameter">out</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">left</code>, which is the existing sample in the output
buffer.
</p><p>
Now add the value of the <code class="varname">stereo</code> flag to the input pointer. This will only
increment the input pointer if the sound is in stereo format (remember
that <code class="varname">stereo</code> is 0 for mono and 1 for stereo). That way, when you read the
right channel, if the sound is stereo, you'll get the right channel's
sample, but if the sound is mono, the left channel will be duplicated
into the right.
</p><p>
Process the right channel's sample, <code class="varname">sample1</code>, the same way.
</p><p>
Now you have to deal with possible clipping problems. Clipping occurs
when the value of the mixed samples is outside the range that can be
represented by a 16-bit number. This is why you mix the sounds in 32-bit
variables: You can detect overflow and compensate for it.
</p><p>
First, add $8000 to the left and right samples we've mixed, then mask off
the low word. This value, stored in <code class="varname">temp0</code>
for the left channel and <code class="varname">temp1</code>
for the right, is non-zero if the sample overflowed.
</p><p>
Now store the sample into the output buffer. If <code class="varname">temp0</code> (for the left
channel) or <code class="varname">temp1</code> (for the right channel) is non-zero, replace the output
sample with $7FFF if the sample is positive (this is the maximum possible
sample value) or $8000 if the sample is negative (this is the minimum
possible sample value). This clips the sample to the range of valid
16-bit integers without accidentally wrapping around and sounding
*really* strange.
</p><p>
Finally, increment the <code class="varname">out</code> pointer to point to the next frame of audio in
the output buffer, and increment <code class="varname">frame</code>, which is the number of frames
you've processed so far, and continue looping until the desired number of
frames have been mixed into the output buffer.

16-bit input data is handled almost exactly the same way, with two
significant differences: WAVE files don't need special consideration, and
you have to deal with both big-endian and little-endian input.
</p><p>
Since BeOS is natively big-endian, you have to use the <code class="function">read_16_swap()</code>
function to read little-endian data. This function returns, byte-swapped,
the 16-bit value located at a given address. The input data is pointed to
here by shortIn, which represents the 16-bit input data. Otherwise, this
code is exactly the same as the 8-bit code above.

This code can be called easily from your stream function to mix any kind

assumes the existence of certain variables. Normally you'll have these
within the class containing the hook function, but space doesn't permit
me to show the entire class. These variables are:
</p><p>
<code class="varname">playFrameNumber</code>: Specifies the frame number of the first frame of audio
data to play.
</p><p>
<code class="varname">soundLength</code>: Specifies the length, in frames, of the sound being played.

<code class="varname">soundData</code>: Pointer to the sound data to play.
</p><p>
<code class="varname">fileFormat</code>, <code class="varname">byteOrder</code>,
<code class="varname">sampleSize</code>, and <code class="varname">channelCount</code> specify the file
format, byte ordering, sample size, and number of channels in the sound.
These are passed straight through to <code class="methodname">MixStandardFrame()</code>.

This hook function starts by looking to see if the sound has finished
playing (the frame to be played is greater than or equal to the number of
frames in the sound); if so, it returns <code class="constant">false</code>, which tells the
<code class="classname">BSubscriber</code> to remove us from the stream.
</p><p>
Now compute the number of frames to copy into the buffer, by dividing the
size of the file in bytes by four and storing that result in <code class="varname">frameCount</code>.
Each frame of 16-bit stereo sound is four bytes long.
</p><p>
If the number of frames left to play in the sound (<code class="varname">soundLength</code> -
<code class="varname">playFrameNumber</code>) is less than the number of frames in the buffer, change
<code class="varname">frameCount</code> to that value. This can happen when you are approaching the
end of the sound, and there are fewer frames of sound left to play than
there are in the buffer you've received.
</p><p>
Once that's all done, call <code class="methodname">MixStandardFrames()</code> to mix the sound into the
buffer, then add <code class="function">frameCount</code> to <code class="function">playFrameNumber</code>
to keep track of the next
frame to be played. Finally, return <code class="constant">true</code>, which
tells the <code class="classname">BSubscriber</code>
that you're not done playing yet.

Perhaps this isn't the best of weeks to discuss e-commerce, right in the
wake of an ambitious announcement from one of our noble and worthy
elders, but we just made the BeOS available for Web download (visit
http://www.be.com/products/beos_download/.
</p><p>
From one angle, this isn't news, we said we'd do it, we're doing it, a
little late, we're just doing our job and, in any case, doesn't everyone
promote and deliver their software on the Web? True. But, from another
angle, our latest move raises a few questions. The hardest one stems from
the "free trial" status of our product. If we start on that slope, some
critics say, how are we going to make money, how are we going to wean
users from the "free BeOS habit"?
</p><p>
Here is our perspective: The world isn't waiting for us, we've got to
earn the trust and the commitment of developers and customers. The BeOS
is an unproven platform within a context where one company, Microsoft, is
enormously successful, and other operating systems have slowed down, in
the best of cases, or failed. Of course, in order to make our case, we
can write columns, go to industry conferences and give speeches, or go to
trade shows and run demonstrations. This is good, necessary perhaps, but
not sufficient.
</p><p>
Clearly positioning the product is good, comparing the benefits of a
specialized Media OS versus the comforts and limits of a general-purpose
platform is commendable marketing hygiene. Opposing IBM's strategy with
OS/2 (better DOS than DOS, better Windows than Windows) to our goal of
coexisting with Windows is a useful disclaimer.
</p><p>
But, in the end, the most potent marketing weapon in our business still
is word-of-mouth. If users and developers say good things about the BeOS
and our company, its business practices and its people, this is much more
credible than any commercial. If, on the contrary, our product is
perceived as poorly designed, our staff as unresponsive, no amount of
advertising will correct the problem.
</p><p>
This is well and good, but it doesn't quite address the "freebie habit"
problem. Why don't we charge for PR2 downloads? After all, it's nice,
stable and usable, right?
</p><p>
Right now, our view is we need to develop the installed base of BeOS
users more than we need the revenue. We'd rather make this investment as
soon as possible, learn what users like and dislike and maximize the
installed based BeOS developers can count on.
</p><p>
And, as we plan to enter the Intel space, we want to gather as much
momentum and experience as possible, while keeping in mind that this new
field isn't the PowerPC market, only bigger. Mac developers have
discovered that fact when they moved to Windows. The context, the
competition, the belief systems, the purchasing habits are all different.
Which puts us in the slightly paradoxical situation of wanting to gain
experience quickly while realizing that the knowledge gained must be
applied selectively.
</p><p>
Back to the main issue, our current plan is to let the trial version,
free, and the paid for product coexist. Many companies do that today, and
rather successfully. You can use Eudora Lite or pay for Eudora Pro, your
choice. You can use QuickView, or pay for the QuickView Plus version,
both very nice products. And there are many, many more such examples.
</p><p>
These companies obviously want to make it easy for the prospective paying
customer to make up his or her mind, and they have faith in the
statistical outcome of the trial. Qualcomm, for instance, knows some
people will keep using the "free" Eudora Lite instead of forking the $50
or so required for the Pro version. But, as long as the "Lite" users are
happy, they contribute to the positive buzz about Eudora. This, I hasten
to say, doesn't mean to represent our detailed calculus of possibilities
for the free vs. paid for versions of the BeOS, these examples merely
intend to show it can work and that users are willing to move from free
to "commercial."
</p><p>
We'll keep in mind that history repeats itself in mysterious way as we
happily add bandwidth for the demand created by the Web availability of
our product—and as we are chasing freshly discovered bugs.

The drag-a-window-between-workspaces feature was a new found source of
amusement for one of our listeners. Although initially offered as an
off-topic thread, others joined in to offer window management
suggestions:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Hot-key window delivery: Bucky bit-click on a window to send it
to some other workspace.
</p></li><li><p>
Workspace scrolling.
</p></li><li><p>
Multiple graphics card support, with separate workspaces running
on each.
</p></li><li><p>
Spatial arrangement of workspaces to support multi-headed setups.
</p></li><li><p>
Smarter desktop layout when switching from a big to a small
workspace.
</p></li></ul><p>
The spatial arrangement/multi-headed question generated the most
debate: Should individual workspaces be views into a single universal
workspace area? Should each monitor have its own list of workspaces
that it can switch to, exclusive of all other monitors? And so on.

Jerome Chan is curious:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">How hard is it to write a web browser? I mean, if the Linux people can
write an entire OS why can't we write a web browser ourselves?</span>”
</p><p>
Craig Longman suggests looking at the HTML spec to get an idea of the
task's complexity. And then move on to Java, and JavaScript, and CSS...
Pierre-Emmanuel Chaut pointed out that many of the elements of a good
browser are already available (through Kftp, rRaster, Felix, and so
on). It's (ahem) simply a matter of putting the pieces together.
Various members of the BeDevTalk community offered their services for a
international group effort.
</p><p>
The thread then veered into a discussion of XML ("Extensible Markup
Language") vs HTML. Is XML the Web language of the future?
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id602188"></a>Subject: VirtualMemory Swap on Alternate Drive</h4></div></div></div><p>
Swap file questions:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
How about providing a "remote" swap file feature, in which the
swap file is on a different drive?
</p></li><li><p>
How about a swap file on a separate partition?
</p></li><li><p>
the kernel handle multiple swap files?
</p></li></ul><p>
The swap-file-across-a-wire idea was generally accepted as an obviously
beneficial improvement. But does it make sense to dedicate a partition
as a swap file? Jake Hamby points out that the BeOS is quite efficient
when handling VM I/O, so assigning a partition might not gain anything.
Osma Ahvenlampi offered this: If you can physically place the partition
on the outer cylinders, you can take advantage of the cylinders'
naturally heightened speed.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: (From Dominic Giampaolo) Although the kernel can handle
"remote" swap files, there's currently no way to tell it to do so.
We'll consider it, but it's not likely to happen in the next release.

John Tegen sent a well-reasoned description of the necessity of and
requirements for an intelligent open system. But where to go from here,
wherever "here" is?
</p><p>
Somehow, the thread immediately skidded into a discussion of the
"Project Magic" Opera browser. A number of listeners have pledged their
money to this port; others question the wisdom of buying a product
before it exists.
</p><p>
More interestingly (and generally), the notion of "nativeness" was
scrutinized. Is moving code from one platform to another and stitching
up the loose ends enough to deem the result "native"? Many folks don't
think so. A native app should take advantage of an OS's features, which
implies a significant amount of rewriting. In the case of the BeOS,
according to Jon Watte, a primary feature that should be taken
advantage of is the multi-threaded environment:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">There is no shame in having written code that does not port cleanly to
the BeOS, because you couldn't know that we would come along and
suddenly do everything so much better. However, what we do is make sure
that there is glory in writing code that DOES work in a multi-threaded
environment.</span>”

And the subscription model</h4></div></div></div><p>
Which headers should an app developer use when compiling? Are older
headers (where PR1 is oldest) better because of the larger customer
base? Or, given the subscription model, will all/most users be
automatically "on the bus"?
</p><p>
Relatedly, it was suggested that the compiler should note the version
of the OS that an app is compiled under. If the app is launched on a
newer version, a "renew your OS subscription" Alert could pop up.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: You should compile against the headers of the oldest OS
version that you want to run on. This means, of course, that you can't
take advantage of newer features.
