One of the new features in DR8 is message filtering, which is based on
the <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> class. This class, along with associated functions in
<code class="classname">BLooper</code> and <code class="classname">BHandler</code>,
gives developers a powerful tool for filtering
messages. Prior to DR8, the BeOS allowed you to filter only a few
system-defined messages, such as <code class="constant">B_MOUSE_DOWN</code> and <code class="constant">B_KEY_DOWN</code>. This
old-style filtering was part of the <code class="classname">BWindow</code> class (see the sections on
<code class="classname">BWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">FilterMouseDown</code>, <code class="methodname">FilterKeyDown</code>,
and so on in The Be Book). The
new filtering system is much improved.
</p><p>
It's worth noting that the old style of filtering still exists in DR8,
but it's on the chopping block, and one day soon it will be gone. So
now's the time to learn about the new filtering mechanism and to update
your code.
</p><p>
<code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> provides two styles of filtering. The first is based on a
built-in hook function, which you can override in your subclass:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
virtual <span class="type">filter_result</span>
  <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>::<code class="methodname">Filter</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code> *<code class="parameter">msg</code>, <code class="classname">BHandler</code> **<code class="parameter">target</code>)
</pre><p>
The <code class="methodname">Filter()</code> function is then called for any message that matches the
"filter" criteria. The target parameter indicates which handler is
destined to receive the message. By passing a pointer to a pointer,
you're allowed to alter the target. The hook function returns a
filter_result that is either <code class="constant">B_SKIP_MESSAGE</code> or <code class="constant">B_DISPATCH_MESSAGE</code>. The
latter tells the system to continue processing the message, while the
former says to stop, the message should be discarded.
</p><p>
<code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> also supports a function pointer interface, removing the
need for subclassing (this ought to make some of you out there happy).
With this style you can define a filter function like so:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">filter_result</span>
  <code class="function">my_filter_func</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code> *<code class="parameter">msg</code>, <code class="classname">BHandler</code> **<code class="parameter">target</code>,
      <code class="classname">BLooper</code> *<code class="parameter">looper</code>)
</pre><p>
You can then pass a pointer to this function to the <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>
constructor:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
new <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>(... &lt;other arguments&gt; ...,
     <code class="parameter">my_filter_func</code>)
</pre><p>
What's with "&lt;other arguments&gt;" you might ask? Let me explain. The
<code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> class is designed to filter messages using various
criteria, specified using these &lt;other arguments&gt;. Are you interested in
a filtering a particular kind of message, for example, the <code class="constant">B_MOUSE_DOWN</code>
message, or are you interested in any message sent by a particular party,
for example, any third party? Maybe you're interested in some
combination? <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>s give you all this power and more.
</p><p>
There are three distinct characteristics of a message that can be used to
define the filter criteria:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
"How" How did the message arrive. Was it dropped by a user or
programatically delivered using <code class="methodname">PostMessage</code> or
<code class="methodname">SendMessage</code>. The options
are <code class="constant">B_ANY_DELIVERY</code>, <code class="constant">B_DROPPED_DELIVERY</code>,
or <code class="constant">B_PROGRAMMED_DELIVERY</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
"Who" Who originated the message. Was it the app itself or was it
some other application. The options are <code class="constant">B_ANY_SOURCE</code>,
<code class="constant">B_LOCAL_SOURCE</code>, or <code class="constant">B_REMOTE_SOURCE</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
"What" What type of message is it. This is the "what" field of a
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> and can be any value.
</p></li></ul><p>
Now the "&lt;other arguments&gt;" will make sense:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
new <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>(<span class="type">message_delivery</span> <code class="parameter">how</code>,
                   <span class="type">message_source</span>   <code class="parameter">who</code>,
                   <span class="type">ulong</span>            <code class="parameter">what</code>)
</pre><p>
These three criteria can be combined in arbitrary ways. Here are several
examples:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
You want to filter a particular message, say B_KEY_DOWN, but you're
not interested in how the message was delivered or who sent the
message. Here's the filter to want:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
new <code class="classname">TMyMessageFilter</code>(<code class="constant">B_ANY_DELIVERY</code>, <code class="constant">B_ANY_SOURCE</code>,
     <code class="constant">B_KEY_DOWN</code>)
</pre><p>
This example is basically mimics the old-style <code class="classname">BWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">FilterKeyDown</code>()
function.
</p></li><li><p>
You want to filter any dropped message that came from another
application, and instead of subclassing and overriding the <code class="methodname">Filter()</code>
function, you've decided to write your own filter function:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
new <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>(<code class="constant">B_DROPPED_DELIVERY</code>, <code class="constant">B_REMOTE_SOURCE</code>,
    <code class="varname">my_filter</code>)
</pre><p>
By not specifying a particular "what" field, all dropped messages will
be filtered, regardless of the "what" field.
</p></li><li><p>
You're really nosy and want to peak at every stinking message. Here's
what you would do:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
new <code class="classname">TNosyMessageFilter</code>(<code class="constant">B_ANY_DELIVERY</code>, <code class="constant">B_ANY_SOURCE</code>)
</pre></li></ul><p>
Now that you know how to create filters, you need to know how to attach
them to loopers and handlers in order to actually do anything. You've got
a couple of options here. You can filter messages targeted for a specific
handler, for example, a specific view in a window. Or you can filter all
messages that go through a particular looper, for example, all messages
being dispatched by a window. You chose between these alternative by
adding the filter to the appropriate object:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BLooper</code>::<code class="methodname">AddCommonFilter</code>(<code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> *<code class="parameter">filter</code>)
</pre><p>
or
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BHandler</code>::<code class="methodname">AddFilter</code>(<code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> *<code class="parameter">filter</code>)
</pre><p>
Filters added to a handler only apply to that handler, while filters
added to a looper using <code class="methodname">AddCommonFilter</code> apply to all messages dispatched
by that looper.
</p><p>
That's about all there is to filtering. Until next time, happy filtering.

I'll admit it. I didn't have enough time to spend on this week's article.
I was off in Seattle giving demos and writing articles for magazines. So
those of you who are very astute will notice that I'm treading water this
week and only offering what amounts to a lot of filler. But I want to
stay in your face and on your mind lest you forget how nifty and neat the
BeOS is to program and use.
</p><p>
First of all, although I've been very busy, I still have a coding sample.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/Multipede.tgz
</p><p>
Multipede is a very minimalist port of the xcentipede game. This is an
arcade classic. The primary feature of this little app is that it
demonstrates how to use the following:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>
GameStick from previous newsletter
</li><li>
Messaging
</li><li>
BWindowScreen
</li><li>
Graphics stuff
</li></ul><p>
Of particular interest might be the ATicker class. This is a simple
thread-based ticker, which can generate a Tick() at any given interval,
or rate, using any units of time. It's used by the GameStick object to
periodically poll the joystick position.
</p><p>
You may also find the AThread object (oskernel.h) useful as a simple
encapsulation of the thread functions of the BeOS. This is very useful in
many different areas when you may not feel comfortable with the standard
'C' interface to threads the OS provides.
</p><p>
The original X-based code was all in one file. It was compact and pretty
straightforward. The Multipede release consists of many files, it's more
modular, and, I believe, easily understood. I tried to create a sample
that was first, a native implementation of the BeOS, and second, easy to
understand and useful for subclassing. So there you have it.

Title: BetMap<br />
Location: ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/editors/BetMap.tgz<br />
Author: CHAUT Pierre-Emmanuel (pierre@ina.fr)
</p><p>
This is a funky paint program that shows great spirit. The general
concept is that everything is a plug in. You drag and drop tools from
browser windows to make them active; then you use them. The interface is
not what you typically expect of a paint program, and some have commented
that it is harder to use. But the author has made what I would classify
as a valiant effort in producing an architecture that makes extreme use
of components. It's in the same vein as the AudioElements program
mentioned earlier.
</p><p>
Whether you like the interface this program uses or not, every developer
could stand to win by adopting such an open extension to their
application by way of add-on support.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id504396"></a>Good News</h3></div></div></div><p>
Well the good news is we'll be releasing some more of the code to the
applications found in the /apps folder. The bad news is, some of the apps
don't have what we would call 'pretty' code. These apps will take some
time to release. We want to release them in a little bit better form than
as raw, uncommented shovel ware, but the tutorials will take some time.
The general criteria for release will be:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>
Is the code commented and readable.
</li><li>
Does the code demonstrate sound coding style for the BeOS
</li></ul><p>
On the early release list will be:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>
Clock
</li><li>
Edit
</li><li>
FontDemo
</li><li>
Kaleidoscope
</li><li>
Mandelbrot
</li><li>
ImageViewer
</li><li>
PlaySound
</li><li>
PoorMan
</li><li>
Pulse
</li></ul><p>
Later arrivals will be:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li>
CDPlayer
</li><li>
Edit
</li><li>
IconWorld
</li><li>
MiniPlayer
</li><li>
MineSweeper
</li></ul><p>
All the others were not fit for human consumption, or are so out of date
that they are not relevant, or have a license agreement that prevents
source from being released.
</p><p>
I would like to get them up on the ftp site as quickly as possible before
they become irrelevant in the face of the DR9 release, at which time they
will be updated and released again, or a new crop of more tintillating
examples will be developed.

So there you have it. No pontification or cheerleading this week. Just
some code samples and promises of more code samples.
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-47"></a>Be Developer Talk: AppSketcher Available Now for Free!</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Marc</span> <span class="surname">Verstaen</span></span></div></div></div><p>
While the AppModeler development toolkit never came out with DR8 as
announced, AppSketcher replaces it now. A few more weeks were needed to
make it solid and robust, ready to increase Be developers' productivity.
Many Be developers have been helping us to enhance AppSketcher, with
relevant comments in the comp.sys.be newsgroup and the BeDevTalk mailing
list. Beta testers were also very helpful in our efforts to design an
object development tool that provides benefits to the whole Be developer
community.
</p><p>
Why and What Is AppSketcher?
</p><p>
Although Be Interface Kit is very easy to use and to program with, most
of us prefer to concentrate on the development of specific parts of our
applications, rather than spending time generating a coherent user
interface.
</p><p>
As you will discover, AppSketcher is more or less a nutshell: All it
knows is that a world can be described with windows, views, controls, and
menus. But no particular object is loaded the first time you launch
AppSketcher, so the first step is to parse the header files corresponding
to the kits provided by our favorite Be engineers. Then AppSketcher knows
more: It can manipulate objects from the Interface Kit and even create
applications. You can now design your interface graphically, connect
control objects to your functions, even test your user interface. What
comes next depends only on you: If the objects provided by Be fulfill
your needs, you don't need to read more. But if you want to implement
your own objects, with their own look and feel, or if you want to set
some parameters for objects directly in AppSketcher, then you will have
to teach it about your own classes. As part of this process, you will
modify AppSketcher and increase the range of its features. Our job is
done now, and we're waiting for you to take care of our child and to help
him become a grown-up.
</p><p>
What Can You Expect from AppSketcher?
</p><p>
AppSketcher offers:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A graphical interface design tool, which can be used interactively
</p></li><li><p>
The capability to add C++ objects, either as interface elements or
simply as objects that applications create
</p></li><li><p>
A way to connect interface items (controls) with the member functions
of the objects that have been added
</p></li><li><p>
A process for initializing object members with the pointer to other
application components
</p></li><li><p>
A tool you can use throughout a project's lifetime
</p></li></ul><p>
All you have to do now is connected to the Be web site, download
AppSketcher, and read its documentation. (AppSketcher will be available
in the Developer area of the Be web site this week. Watch the What's New
page for the announcement.)
</p><p>
We'd like to thank Be, Inc., whose BeOS has made the one- year-old
AppSketcher application possible. All of us at Lorienne [Now BeatWare]
were very pleased to work with talented Be team.

Once again, we're treated to a great show. Fortunately, there's also
substance behind the verbal pyrotechnics and the demos. I'm referring to
the most recent Network Computer announcements—of course. And I'm
betting we'll all benefit in the end from the sometimes raucous conflict
between the advocates of the NC and the defenders of the PC.
</p><p>
But let's start with the basics. Ostensibly, the NC is a way to fight the
ever-increasing cost of ownership of a PC. A number of studies by the
Gartner Group or Forrester Research agree corporations spend around
$10,000 per year, per PC. The culprit is the growing disorder and fat
afflicting hardware and software configurations.
</p><p>
For years, Sun has claimed the newtwork _is_ the computer, and they built
a nice business on that claim. They also transmogrified their set-top box
language, OAK, into Java, a way to design and deliver
platform-independent applications. Et voila, all the ingredients for NC.
Just a processor, memory, and network connection and you have a machine
that's both less expensive to purchase and to own. Less expensive to
purchase because you get rid of unnecessary organs, such as the floppy,
the hard disk, or a bus. Less expensive to own because all the data and
programs are centrally (and thus more safely and economically) managed.
When you need it, you invoke the Java word processor from the server.
When you're done, it disappears without cluttering your system. Clean
computing.
</p><p>
We know, of course, life is never that simple. Nagging questions arose
immediately. Such as the need for some caching device. A hard disk,
perhaps. But then, what's the difference with a PC? The fact Microsoft
doesn't control the architecture? Unfortunately, the argument degenerated
into an anti-Microsoft one, confusing what the NC does for the customer
with what it does against Microsoft.
</p><p>
In the early days of the NC battle of words, Bill Gates openly derided
the concept, pointing to the weak difference in hardware costs between a
PC and an NC. But the issue of cost of ownership did not go away,
especially with the sometimes painful transition from Windows 3.1 to
Windows 95 and Windows NT. Larry Ellison and Scott McNealy are powerful
ideologues and very successful businessmen. Their advocacy of the NC
carries weight, and Java gained traction, now assured of becoming a
mainstream language.
</p><p>
So what did Bill Gates do? Last week, at the Agenda Conference in
Phoenix, Arizona, Larry Ellison had an off day. His pitch for the NC
wasn't as calm and statesmanlike as we were used to expect from him. Bill
Gates, on the contrary, decided to embrace the key NC concepts and, by
pure coincidence, the official announcement came yesterday, right on the
eve of Sun's official NC intro. There are some good ideas there, some
real problems, said Bill. We'll have a simplified PC architecture
supported by Compaq, Hewlett- Packard, Dell, and other noted players. It
will be less expensive to purchase and to own because we'll offer the
capability to centrally manage data and application software.
</p><p>
Critics say it's a mere retooling of the SIPC, the Simple Interactive PC
architecture previewed in February. It doesn't matter. What counts is
what will be delivered, by whom, and when. In the end, we're likely to
get in the healthy habit of delivering and updating software
automatically over the network, the Internet or the intranet, thus making
users and software developers happier. Plus it will make a couple of
companies, such as Marimba, who've already thought of that business,
richer.
