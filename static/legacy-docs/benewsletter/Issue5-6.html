Once upon a time I wrote an article about using
<acronym class="acronym" title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym> from user space.
Those tools are handy for prototyping and many simple projects, but often
you need a real <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> driver (perhaps to fit into an existing driver model
like mice, keyboards, or audio devices). We'll take a look at the gritty
details and some important rules for <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> drivers. A sample driver that
can dump raw audio data to <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> speakers is provided to illustrate the
points below.
</p><p>
This article refers to the V2 version of the bus manager that will ship
in BeOS 5. The sample code includes header files for this new interface.
Please note that this code will not operate correctly under R4.x (and
will not even build if you use the system headers).
</p><p>
You can get the source code and follow along if you like:
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/drivers/usb_speaker.zip&gt;.
</p><p>
The USB 1.1 Specification and specific device class specifications are
available online in PDF format:
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.usb.org/developers/docs.html">http://www.usb.org/developers/docs.html</a>.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id451877"></a>The USB Bus Manager</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Universal Serial Bus is far more dynamic than some of the other
busses we support under BeOS. Users can and will hot plug and unplug
devices. The dull old "load driver," "look for devices," "publish
devices," techniques will not work very well here. We're using USB as a
test bed for the next revision of the BeOS driver model, which will treat
all busses as dynamic entities and be better prepared for other
interesting device events, like power management.
</p><p>
When a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> driver loads, it's expected to register itself with the bus
manager using <code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">register_driver()</code></code>.
The name of the driver must be
provided (so the bus manager can reload it on demand), as well as a list
of supported devices. This takes the form of an array of
<span class="type">usb_support_descriptor</span> structures. Each entry represents a pattern that
may have a value (or the wild card 0) for the class, subclass, protocol,
vendor, and device fields. The sample driver provided supports <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> audio
devices (all devices that have a class value of 1).
</p><p>
Once registered, the driver must request notification of devices that it
may be interested in. A set of <span class="type">notify_hooks</span> (currently <code class="function">device_added</code> and
<code class="function">device_removed</code>) are installed using
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">install_notify()</code></code>. These hooks
must be uninstalled before the driver unloads using
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">uninstall_notify()</code></code>.
</p><p>
Once the hooks are installed, <code class="function">device_added()</code> will be called every time a
device that matches (in its <span class="type">configuration_descriptor</span> or an interface
descriptor) the pattern in one of the supplied support descriptors
appears. If there are already such devices plugged in, these calls will
occur before <code class="function">install_notify</code> returns.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id452379"></a>Adding and Removing Devices</h3></div></div></div><p>
The <code class="function">device_added()</code> hook receives a <span class="type">usb_device</span> pointer (the opaque handle
that represents a particular <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> device on the bus). The driver may
further investigate the device (for example, our sample only supports
audio devices that support 16-bit stereo streams) and indicate whether it
wants to keep it.
</p><p>
If <code class="constant">B_OK</code> is returned, the driver may use the <span class="type">usb_device</span> handle and any
associated resources until <code class="function">device_removed()</code> is called. Once
<code class="function">device_removed()</code> returns, the driver MAY NOT use these resources again.
The <code class="parameter">cookie</code> parameter of <code class="function">device_added</code> provides a value that will be passed
to <code class="function">device_removed</code>. If <code class="function">device_added()</code> returns
<code class="constant">B_ERROR</code>, the driver receives
no further notification and may not use the usb_device.
</p><p>
When <code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">uninstall_notify()</code></code>
is called, any devices that still exist are
"removed" (<span class="type">device_removed</span> is called).
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id452465"></a>Putting Theory into Practice</h3></div></div></div><p>
The sample driver maintains a list of devices it knows about (by way of
<code class="function">device_added()</code> calls). The list is protected by a lock and also generates
the list of device names when <code class="function">publish_devices()</code> is called. Each device
entry contains information needed for transfers, a count of how many
instances of it are open, and a unique number allocated on creation. When
a device is removed, its entry is removed from the list, but only
actually removed from memory if the open count is zero.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id513962"></a>Devices, Interfaces, Endpoints, and Pipes</h3></div></div></div><p>
As mentioned above, each device is represented by a usb_device pointer
(an opaque object). The properties of a device, its configurations,
interfaces, and endpoints are described by various descriptors defined by
the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> specification (Chapter 9, in particular, is very useful). The
header <code class="filename">USB_spec.h</code>
contains constants and structures for the various
standard descriptors.
</p><p>
Every device has at least one—and possibly several—configurations.
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">get_nth_configuration()</code></code>
may be used to obtain a <span class="type">configuration_info</span>
object that describes a particular configuration.
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">set_configuration()</code></code>
is used to select a configuration and inform the
device of that choice. A configuration value of <code class="constant">NULL</code> means "unconfigure."
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">get_configuration()</code></code>
returns the current configuration (or <code class="constant">NULL</code> if
the device is not configured).
</p><p>
The <span class="type">configuration_info</span> structure contains the configuration descriptor,
as well as an array of <span class="type">interface_list</span> structures. Each <span class="type">interface_list</span>
represents one interface, which may have several alternates. An alternate
interface often provides a slightly different version of the same
resource (for example, an audio device may provide 16-bit stereo, 8-bit
mono, and several other formats).
</p><p>
The <span class="type">interface_list</span> also indicates the currently active interface (the
default is always alt[0]). This value may only be set by
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">set_alt_interface()</code></code>
and must never be changed by hand. IMPORTANT:
<code class="function">set_alt_interface()</code> MUST happen before
<code class="function">set_configuration()</code>—this is a
limitation in the current <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> stack.
</p><p>
Each interface has a descriptor, a number of endpoints (which may be
zero), and a list of "generic" descriptors—descriptors specific to the
interface (audio interfaces provide a descriptor that describes the audio
data format, for example).
</p><p>
Each endpoint structure includes the endpoint descriptor (which indicates
the type, direction, max bandwidth, as per the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> spec) as well as a
pointer to a <span class="type">usb_pipe</span>. Initially, every endpoint's <span class="type">usb_pipe</span> pointer is
<code class="constant">NULL</code>, but when a device is configured (with
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">set_configuration()</code></code>), the
pipes of the active interfaces are valid handles used to send or receive
data.
</p><p>
Here's an example of a typical audio device (usually the audio streaming
interface has several alternates with various other supported formats):
</p><pre class="screen">
usb_device
  configuration[0]
    interface[0]
      (class 1, subclass 1: Audio Control)
      alternate[0]
    interface[1]
      (class 1, subclass 2: Audio Streaming)
      alternate[0]
        (default, uses no bandwidth)
      alternate[1]
        endpoint[0]
        (isochronous out, 56 bytes per packet max)
        generic[0..2]
        (audio descriptors, format 8-bit mono)
      alternate[2]
        endpoint[0]
        (isochronous out, 224 bytes per packet max)
        generic[0..2]
        (audio descriptors, format 16-bit stereo)
    interface[2]
      (class 3: Human Interface (volume buttons))
      alternate[0]
        endpoint[0]
        (interrupt in, 1 byte per packet max)
        generic[0]
        (HID descriptor)
</pre></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id516523"></a>Sending and Receiving Data</h3></div></div></div><p>
One very important thing to remember with <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> drivers is that you can't
use stack-allocated structures with the <code class="function">queue_*()</code> IO functions. They are
completed in a service thread that doesn't have access to the stack that
the operations were initiated from. If you use stack-allocated
structures, your driver will crash. Also, the current stack requires that
data buffers for bulk, isochronous, and interrupt transactions be
contiguous in physical memory. This limitation may be lifted in a future
version, but for now, be careful.
</p><p>
Every device has a pipe to endpoint 0, the default control pipe. The
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">send_request()</code></code>
call is used to send control requests (which involve
an 8-byte command sent from the host, optionally followed by some number
of bytes sent to or received from the device). Control requests are used
to configure devices, clear error conditions, and do other housekeeping.
Many of the convenience functions provided by the bus manager (set/clear
feature, get_descriptor, and so on) result in control requests.
</p><p>
For any other type of transaction you'll need a <span class="type">usb_pipe</span> object, which
will be allocated to each endpoint in each active interface when
<code class="function">set_configuration()</code> succeeds as described above.
</p><p>
The <code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">queue_interrupt()</code></code> and
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">queue_bulk()</code></code> calls may be used to
enqueue requests to interrupt or bulk endpoints, respectively. A callback
must be provided to allow the stack to inform your driver when the
requests complete. The direction of data transfer is dictated by the
direction of the endpoint (as detailed in its descriptor). The callback
is called on completion of the transaction (with success or failure) or
if the transfer is cancelled with
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">cancel_queued_transfers()</code></code>.
</p><p>
Isochronous transfers are more complicated, and require that the driver
inform the stack ahead of time so that adequate resources may be
dedicated. Since isochronous transfers provide guaranteed bandwidth, the
stack needs to pre-allocate various transfer descriptors specific to the
host controller to insure that everything is handled in a timely fashion.
</p><p>
<code class="code"><code class="varname">usb</code>-&gt;<code class="function">set_pipe_policy()</code></code>
is employed to configure an isochronous pipe in
this fashion. It uses the provided buffer count to determine how many
requests may be outstanding at once, the duration in milliseconds to
determine the number of frames of data that will be provided, and the
sample size to insure that frames are always a correct multiple of the
sample size.
</p><p>
usb-&gt;queue_isochronous() starts an isochronous transfer on the next
frame. While bulk and interrupt transfers provide a simple actual_length
parameter to their callback, which indicates how much data has been sent
or received (in the event of a short transfer), isochronous pipes use
run-length encoding records to describe which data actually made it
intact (since it's possible that only bits and pieces of an inbound
isochronous stream arrived intact). The USB_rle.h header has extensive
comments explaining these structures.
</p><p>
In the current stack, it takes 10ms for the first isochronous transfer on
a pipe to start. Provided you keep queuing up additional transfers, there
will be one packet per frame.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id516658"></a>About USB Transactions</h3></div></div></div><p>
Isochronous transactions get dedicated bandwidth and happen every frame.
Delivery is not guaranteed, but timing is.
</p><p>
Interrupt transactions are scheduled to happen on a polling interval of N
milliseconds (no less often than once every N frames). They give the
device (for example, a mouse) an opportunity to send some data (up to the
specified max packet size) or a NAK, indicating no data is ready.
</p><p>
Control requests actually consist of two or three transactions—a setup
phase to send the 8-byte control message, an optional data phase for the
device to send or receive data, and an acknowledge phase where the data
(or lack thereof) is acknowledged or an error is signaled via a STALL
condition.
</p><p>
Bulk transactions guarantee delivery but not timing—they use as much
bandwidth as is available (and not allocated to interrupt or isochronous
transfers) to send or receive data.
</p><p>
Every endpoint specifies a max packet size—the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> stack will never
violate this size and will break up longer queued requests into as many
individual packets as required to complete the request. The exception is
isochronous transactions, which must declare buffering information ahead
of time with <code class="function">set_pipe_policy()</code>

This week's article is all about making use of Drag'n'Drop with BeOS, an
apparently simple task that has some unseen (but useful) complications.
This is going to be a "high-level" article. By some strange coincidence,
I've just finished writing the detailed documentation for drag'n'drop,
which should be on the Be Web Site soon, so you can look there for code
examples, and all the picky details.
</p><p>
First, a bit of history, which will be particularly important to those of
you who have been programming BeOS for a long time, and think that the
way you did drag'n'drop way back when is the way you should do it now.
Here's the history:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
In earlier versions of the BeOS, dragging an object from one place to
another corresponded to sending a message from one place to the other.
</p></li><li><p>
Now, it's different.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I did say a _bit_ of history.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id516813"></a>Why Did We Complicate Drag'n'Drop?</h3></div></div></div><p>
The old method of drag'n'drop was simple. I might, for example, have some
text selected in a word-processing application. Assuming the application
supported drags, I could, onscreen, drag the text selection "onto" a
<span class="application">Tracker</span> folder. Internally, this would result
in a <code class="classname">BMessage</code> object being
sent from the application to <span class="application">Tracker</span>; among other things, the message
would contain a string corresponding to the dragged text. Tracker, upon
receiving that message, could inspect it, say, "Aha! Here's some text
data", and make a clipping file out of it.
</p><p>
Now, what happens if the user drags that text onto the trashcan, rather
than onto the desktop or a <span class="application">Tracker</span> folder? Intuitively, it would make
sense that this should do the same thing as hitting the "delete" key--it
should delete the selected text from within the application. However,
this requires an action on the part of the word-processing application;
Tracker can't "reach in" and yank out that text. Unfortunately, since
(under the old-style drag'n'drop) only one message was sent, from the
application to Tracker, there's no way <span class="application">Tracker</span> can request this action of
the word processor. Too bad.
</p><p>
A different facet of this communications problem can be seen by thinking
about a slightly different scenario; dragging selected text from a Web
browser to a word processor. There are two obvious formats the browser
could provide this text in; it could provide the text as "plain" text,
losing all of the formatting imparted by the <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> markup tags, or it
could provide it as "HTML text", keeping the <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> markup tags.
Unfortunately, the browser has no way to decide between the two without
knowing more about the receiving application; if the receiver
"understands" <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>, the browser should probably provide all of the text,
including the markup, but if the receiver doesn't understand <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>, then
it would make more sense for the browser to strip out the <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> tags
before bundling up the text and sending it off to the word processor.
Figuring this out requires some sort of negotiation between the browser
and word processor, or more generally, between the sending application
and receiving application.
</p><p>
The two above shortcomings of "old-style" drag'n'drop--the inability of
the receiver to request actions of the sender, and the inability to
negotiate an "optimal" data format between the sender and receiver--led
to the more recent drag'n'drop protocol, negotiated drag'n'drop.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id516911"></a>A Negotiated Settlement; There will be Peace in Our Time</h3></div></div></div><p>
Negotiated drag'n'drop causes (up to) three <code class="classname">BMessage</code>s to be sent, for
every drag'n'drop the user performs. Here's what the dataflow looks like:
</p><p>
&lt;http://www-classic.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/resources/dragdrop.jpg&gt;
</p><p>
The whole purpose of negotiated drag'n'drop is (surprise!) negotiation,
and the communication to accomplish that negotiation is accomplished via
a predetermined set of message fields in the messages that are flung back
and forth--these fields, and what goes in them, are the negotiation
protocol. I won't go into all of the gory details (that's what the
reference material is for), but let's go back to our example of dragging
text from a Web browser to a word processor to see some of the things
that might happen.
</p><p>
When the user drags and drops the selected text from the web browser to
the word processor, the first message (which is called the _drag message_
in the diagram) will be sent. This message will contain a bunch of
information in various message fields; of interest to us right now are
the "be:actions" and "be:types" message fields. "be:actions" contains a
list of actions that the sending application (the web browser, in this
case) is willing to perform on the dragged data. In this example,
"be:actions" might contain the <code class="constant">B_COPY_TARGET</code>
and <code class="constant">B_TRASH_TARGET</code> values,
indicating that the web browser is willing to either provide a copy of
the dragged data, or to delete it. "be:types" is a list of MIME types
indicating the data formats that the browser is willing to provide the
text in; obvious values for this list are "text/plain" for plaintext, and
"text/html" for text including HTML markup, but what goes in here depends
solely on what the sender application is willing and able to provide.
Note that we don't send any "real" data in the drag message, i.e. the
text itself isn't sent yet.
</p><p>
Now, the word processor receives the drag message, and according to the
negotiation protocol, it knows it can make two choices from the options
provided in the drag message; it can choose the action it will request
the browser to perform, and it can request the data format it wants data
in. If our word processor were really a trashcan, it might request the
<code class="constant">B_TRASH_TARGET</code> action, but it isn't, so it will
request the <code class="constant">B_COPY_TARGET</code>
action, stating that it wants a copy of the data for its own use. As for
the data format, well, that's up to it and what it can handle; if it can
parse <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>, then choosing a format of "text/html" will let it preserve
some or all of the formatting of the original text, otherwise a choice of
"text/plain" will still get the text itself across, and is simple to use.
Let's say it chooses "text/plain"; it then bundles up the chosen
<code class="constant">B_COPY_TARGET</code> action and the chosen "text/plain" data format into a new
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>, and shoots that message back to the browser as the negotiation
message.
</p><p>
When the browser gets the negotiation message, it figure out what the
other application wants, and (in this case) puts a plaintext copy of the
selected text into a new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>, and sends that message--the data
message--back to the word processor. End of process.

Actually, you can do even more than this with negotiated drag'n'drop. You
can pass data through a file, rather than through a <code class="classname">BMessage</code>, convenient
for passing around those 100 megabyte video clips that don't fit too well
in memory. You can exercise finer control over which data formats are
used for the interchange of data. And, by the way, the Translation Kit
works just great when used in conjunction with drag'n'drop.
</p><p>
But all that deserves its own explanation, in the reference material.
(Which is to say, I want to wrap this article up). Once you know the
basics of the drag'n'drop negotiation, and the reasons for that
negotiation (as you do now, right?), all of the details fall into place
easily.
