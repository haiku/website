In a previous newsletter, I described ways to improve drawing performance
by avoiding synchronous calls. In Developer Release 8 of the <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™, we
implement our own advice with <code class="classname">BView</code>'s new
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code> function.
</p><p>
As the name implies, <code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code> issues an order to draw (it sends
the request to the app server) and then immediately returns—it doesn't
wait for the drawing to finish the way the regular <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code> function
does. The advantage of the asynchronous call is obvious: Your thread can
do something useful instead of waiting around for the server to get done.
However, with the advantage comes a responsibility: After calling
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapSync()</code>, you have to make sure that the drawing is completed
before you modify or delete the bitmap.
</p><p>
How can you do that?
</p><p>
The most obvious way would be to (explicitly) call <code class="classname">BView</code>'s <code class="methodname">Sync()</code>
function after calling <code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code>. This approach only makes sense,
of course, if you perform some other operations between the draw and the
sync—otherwise you lose your no-waiting advantage. In other words,
calling <code class="methodname">Sync()</code> immediately after calling <code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code> is essentially
the same as calling <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code>—which is exactly what we're trying to
avoid.
</p><p>
One situation in which <code class="methodname">Sync()</code> can be of use is if you want to draw a
number of bitmaps. You call <code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync()</code> for each bitmap placement,
and THEN you call <code class="methodname">Sync()</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="comment">/* Issue some drawing commands. */</span>
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync</code>(<code class="varname">bmapA</code>, <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(0,0));
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync</code>(<code class="varname">bmapB</code>, <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(50,0));
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync</code>(<code class="varname">bmapC</code>, <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(100,0));
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync</code>(<code class="varname">bmapB</code>, <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(150,0));

<span class="comment">/* Now wait for ALL of them to complete... */</span>
<code class="methodname">Sync</code>();

<span class="comment">/* ...before changing one of the bitmaps and redrawing. */</span>
<code class="methodname">ChangeBitmap</code>(<code class="varname">bmapA</code>):
<code class="methodname">DrawBitmapAsync</code>(<code class="varname">bmapA</code>, <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(200,0));
</pre><p>
How much faster is the asynchronous method? It depends on the size of the
bitmap. For small, icon-sized bitmaps, you'll find that your bitmap
drawing can be as much as 4 times faster! The Minesweeper application
makes good use of asynchronous drawing; so does the Browser (which plays
a fun game of knowing which bitmap has been drawn out of its icon cache).
</p><p>
One last thing...
</p><p>
I've noticed that many applications make heavy use of the <code class="methodname">Bounds()</code> call.
I ran some benchmarks on my 66 MHz machine that show how expensive that
kind of synchronous request can be: A single, round-trip ticket to
<code class="methodname">Bounds()</code> costs 480 microseconds, whereas a single, asynchronous gallop
through <code class="methodname">MovePenTo()</code> costs only 12 microseconds!
</p><p>
The moral: If you know that the bounds haven't changed, don't call
<code class="methodname">Bounds()</code>.
</p><p>
One more last thing...
</p><p>
If you know that your application's window and view code is carefully
<code class="methodname">Lock()</code>'ed and thoroughly re-entrant, try disabling the window discipline
(through <code class="varname">window</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Discipline</code>(<code class="constant">FALSE</code>)). For simple operations, you might see
a 50 percent speedup. As an example, calling <code class="methodname">SetHighColor()</code> with
discipline enabled takes 19 microseconds; it's only 10 microseconds with
the discipline turned off.
</p><p>
And if you REALLY want to fly:
</p><p>
I've never seen a cop on the stretch of Interstate 280 between Alpine
Road and Page Mill after 2 AM. Disable your discipline and don't call
<code class="methodname">Bounds()</code>.

Deep in the bowels of San Francisco (City Motto: Parking? Who needs
parking?) sulks a less fashionable block of Multimedia Gulch where the
MSNBC/ZDTV studio makes its home. There, on August 7, 1996, I made a
public appearance on behalf of Be, Inc.
</p><p>
The timing of the request for an on-camera demo was interesting: Be had
just announced the demonstration of the BeOS on PowerMac hardware, so
suddenly a story about Be, the BeOS, and the BeBox was an urgent topical
news priority. ...Yes, it has to happen TOMORROW... Yes, we know that all
of the company principals are at Macworld in Boston... Yes, we know that
Macworld is a big event, but no, we didn't send a crew there. Yes, we
still want something for tonight, and no, next week when everyone is back
won't do... Because by then the emergence of a new OS and hardware
platform just won't be news.
</p><p>
Sigh.
</p><p>
So, the next morning I drove off to the city with a BeBox and a full demo
kit of speakers, a MIDI synthesizer, 17" monitor, keyboard, mouse,
cables, power strips... all scrounged from home because the Be demo kits
were busy 3000 miles away in Boston (City Motto: Parking? Try San
Francisco).
</p><p>
I arrived to find the studio well-appointed with sound systems, and
monitors, and curious three-legged tables. So most of the stuff I brought
wasn't really needed anyway. After several layers of pancake to cover the
sweat of jogging three blocks from the nearest open parking spot (oh
never mind, I've beat that joke into the ground), the ZDTV talking head
and I talked about the demo:
</p><p>
Me: We've got symmetric multiprocessing... virtual memory...protected
memory...C++...the <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™...
</p><p>
T. Head: Umm, what we're looking for is something a bit less technical...
</p><p>
Me: Oh. OK. Something my mother might understand, right?
</p><p>
T. Head: Exactly! That's it.
</p><p>
Me: (Sigh.)
</p><p>
We wrapped the demo in two continuous takes, using ultra- hip,
low-altitude, hand-held camera angles, over-the- shoulder boom shots, and
cock-eyed, off-center roving pans. They did a fine job of intercutting
the two takes, leaving in the really important points, while leaving out
some flawed (yet colorful) metaphors.
</p><p>
The distortions of analog video distribution mercifully softened the
picture like an episode of Moonlighting, so my recently acquired gray
hairs weren't that evident. But not even 10 mm of Vaseline smeared on the
lens could have covered up the look I gave the talking head after a
severely misguided opening question. It's a look I usually reserve for
computer salespeople who make uninformed claims that imply that _this_
product is _not_ bound by the same laws of physics as the rest of the
universe.
</p><p>
Overall, I think it was a very positive exposure for Be, and it was, for
me, a great experience.
</p><p>
Other thoughts:
</p><p>
As you all know, Be has achieved a level of newsworthiness due the
announcement of the PowerMac port. As the hardware guy at Be, there was
some parental sadness at seeing our OS take its first steps outside the
hardware home I've made for it, but that feeling is overcome by parental
pride in the potential this child has shown. Be assured there will always
be a place at home for the BeOS, but I'm afraid that I won't promise that
I will keep your room just the way you left it.

DR8 is out, and so is the new and improved CodeWarrior IDE. A lot of
things changed about the way you build Be applications, and although we
tried to document all the needed changes, there are still some questions
that we see over and over again. To try and calm the flood, here's a
DR8/BeIDE FAQ:
</p><div class="qandaset"><table border="0" summary="Q and A Set"><col align="left" width="1%" /><tbody><tr class="question"><td><a id="id498386"></a><a id="id498389"></a>Q:</td><td><p>

libbe.so.
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
libbe.so is in the /system/lib folder. You have to make sure that the
system access paths for your project include /system/lib. Go into
Settings, press Access Paths, and add it if it's not.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id498404"></a><a id="id498406"></a>Q:</td><td><p>

I'm building my application, but its icon goes away and isn't shown.
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
First, make sure that the .rsrc file for your application is added to
the project window.
</p><p>
Second, make sure that the application creator code you set in IconWorld
matches the one set in Project preferences in the IDE.
Third, there exists a bug where the icon can be temporarily disabled when
the output file name in the Project preferences is a path (contains a
slash). We're working on fixing this bug.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
You may wish to do the settings changes mentioned above not only for each
of your projects, but for the "New Projects" target as well, so your
defaults for new projects are correct.
</p><p>
Following these easy steps will ensure that your transition from DR7 to
DR8 is as effortless as possible. Of course, you still have to update all
those places in the API that changed, but we can't help you there.
</p><p>
Good luck!

My web page, which is unlikely to appeal to anyone but me for a while:
http://www.nwlink.com/~jrashmun
</p><p>
After fourteen years at Industrial Systems, Inc. (now part of the
Manufacturing Systems Division of Aspen Tech), I took a year-long leave
of absence, bought a Macintosh, began surfing the Internet, looked up
CodeWarrior (on John Norstad's recommendation), and thereby discovered
the existence of Be. Now I work (almost) full time getting to know the
BeOS, and developing a CORBA-style Object Request Broker (ORB)
implementation.
</p><p>
My favorite computer had been my Amiga 1000. I always regretted that I
couldn't afford to spend what it would have required to be a full-time
Amiga developer. The BeBox gives me a second chance at designing software
for a platform that supports the type of development that I find
gratifying: I like working on the layers of software that help higher-
level applications get their job done. In the two years before my leave,
I developed a multithreaded server in C++ on UNIX—and enjoyed every
moment of it. I love making some little thing work, and then using it to
make some bigger thing work. I love anticipating unexpected uses, so that
when someone says, "It's great... but could you please make it do &lt;XXX&gt;
next time?" I can say, "It's already in there!"
</p><p>
The BeBox is the right platform at the right time. It's fun because it
uses some of the best software ideas in the industry, but isn't burdened
by not-so-good subsystems. Of course, it's not perfect: The OS needs to
have a few more things implemented, and the BeBox crashes fairly often.
Also, it's hard to get the attention of Be's developer support --
although it's always rewarding when they do respond. Please, Be, hire
more developer support people. And, while we're at it, make the bug list
available for review.
</p><p>
I plan to produce an implementation of the C++ mapping for CORBA by the
end of January, 1997, and add support for other languages as they become
available. For distribution, I plan to make the product available on a
web site as Kagi shareware.

I have a such a license plate in my office. But before I go any further,
a few words of apology.
</p><p>
First, to our readers whose mother tongue isn't English. I used the
expression "church key" at the end of my last column and received e-mail
from overseas readers wondering about the meaning and origin of the
trope. Of course, as a late and not completely debugged English speaker,
I find the metaphor pregnant. Just picture one of these large, old,
ornate wrought iron keys. It's the end of the day, hear the hiss when the
church beadle takes the key to the beer bottle...
</p><p>
Second, I'd like to apologize to developers who have suffered while we
switched ISPs and installed a T1 line to support the growing traffic on
our web and ftp servers. This happened at the time when we experienced
increased activity as a result of the PowerMac port demonstrated at
Macworld. By now, we're on our way to catching up with our backlog and
I'd like to express my appreciation to those who contacted me to express
their concern, thus giving me an opportunity to look into the problem and
monitor corrective actions.
</p><p>
Now, to the Amiga. A recent MSNBC broadcast showed the AMIGA96 license
plate given to me by European developers. Some viewers were curious. What
did the license plate mean? This is probably a good opportunity to
acknowledge our spiritual affiliation with the Amiga. In many respects,
it guided our thinking and efforts as we formed the company and developed
our product. In the first place, the Amiga provided an existence proof.
As the millions of Amigas sold attested, you did not have to be
compatible with the Mac or Windows to create a platform and to attract
developers and customers all over the world. With its cousin the Atari
ST, the Amiga proved the existence of an A/V market. The Video Toaster
became the tractor for the Amiga in multimedia content creation.
</p><p>
I was at Apple in 1986 when David Needle and his colleagues introduced
the Amiga, soon acquired by Commodore. We were concerned. We didn't have
a 68020 machine yet, and we didn't have multitasking or any of the audio,
video, graphics, and animation features offered by the Amiga. By the end
of 1988, Bob Kottick and Howard Marks, both Commodore developers,
approached me. Howard had been an intern at Apple France. Investors
wanted to buy Commodore from Irving Gould, its chairman, an avid consumer
of cigars and CEOs. Paul Rainwater, who, if memory serves, managed money
for the Bass family, and Mort Meyerson, Ross Perot ex-number-two at EDS,
showed up at my house in Portola Valley.
</p><p>
Allan Loren, one of my colleagues at Apple, once told me that Ross Perot
had chided him at a job interview for wearing loafers, very proper ones
perhaps, "but at EDS we wear proper shoes with shoelaces, you
understand?" I thought Allan was exaggerating a little. I asked Mort
about his very elegant loafers. He didn't miss a beat and replied, “<span class="quote">I
don't work for Ross anymore.</span>” These well-heeled investors wanted a CEO
for their acquisition. In the end it went nowhere, Irwin wouldn't sell.
Perhaps he remembered my name, though. When I left Apple, he tried to
convince me to run Commodore's R&amp;D. I, in turn, tried to convince him to
let me run the company for 2 or 3 years and to compensate me with 20
percent of the increase in valuation, no salary. That conversation didn't
go anywhere either, but my interest was piqued and, with Steve Sakoman,
we started a company with one goal: Make a 1990s Amiga. We don't know yet
if we've succeeded, but we're happy to acknowledge our debt to a product
that continues to inspire us in many ways.

How many buttons should the developer assume the user's mouse to have?
At least one, certainly, and the consensus is (slightly) in favor of
limiting assumptions to no more than one, but there are some "two is
standard" and "you can't emulate two with one" holdouts. Despite the
dispute, the tenet that a developer should make sure that functionality
isn't lost for lack of a second (or third) button is widely accepted.

Many developers pointed out that they couldn't use their passwords to
get into the Developer's Only section of the Be web site.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: When our web server is down (which it was quite often last
weekend), the developer passwords are refused in a manner that makes it
look like the password was unrecognized. We'll try to fix this so the
reason for the refusal is clear.

These threads reviewed the DR8 improvements (or, as some contend,
stasis) of PPP, PAP/Chap authentication, the ANSI terminal (some folks
want real vt100 emulation), serial port support (see the new Connect
application), and the like.

Pierre Raynaud-Richard's fictionalized account of implementing a
graphics driver (in last week's 'Engineering Insights') tickled some
fancies. A few folks stepped forward to ratify the nightmarish scenario
presented in the story.

Comments, questions, and suggestions regarding NetPositive (the web
browser that's new in DR8). The verdict so far: The app is missing some
features, but it's usable, attractive, and a welcome addition.
