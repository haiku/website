Usually during the course of a day, I encounter something that is
bothersome or just not quite right. The radio in my car is too close to
the cupholder, so whenever I put down my coffee, the station gets
switched from Howard Stern to Rush Limbaugh. Loading a new bottle into
the office water cooler inevitably spills a few drops on the carpet. The
sandwich guy asks my views of mustard versus mayonnaise despite having
heard the full details just seconds earlier.
</p><p>
Porting operating systems to different hardware architectures is no
different. Every system from the Rockwell AIM-65 through the Power
Computing PowerTower Pro dual 225 MHz 604e has quirks that must be dealt
with. Perhaps someday we'll design a system that's perfect, fast,
reliable, and easy to write software for. If whoever builds it needs some
unsolicited advice, I have a list...
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id559552"></a>Logic Design</h3></div></div></div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Put in a software-readable version number. For chips, put in a
read-only register. For circuit boards, dedicate a few I/O bits somewhere
and put in some pull-up/pull-down resistors to make a unique
identification possible. For I/O devices, put it wherever it's
convenient. Whenever a change is made, even one that doesn't affect the
operation of the software, change the version. Someday you'll be glad you
did, be it for manufacturing test, field service, consumer recall,
hardware debug, user interface, or geek fascination with frivolous detail.
</p></li><li><p>
Avoid write-only bits in registers—let software read back what was
written earlier. Avoid bits that mean different things when read and
written—chew up a little decode space instead and put them in separate
registers.
</p></li><li><p>
Design registers that can have individual bits modified in a single
operation. This really helps when there's more than one bus master
mucking about the system, in that register updates don't need to be
protected with a software semaphore lock. My favorite example is the 6522
VIA registers—the most significant bit controls whether you're setting
or clearing, and the rest of the bits have a one wherever a bit is to be
modified and a zero wherever a bit is to remain unchanged.
</p></li><li><p>
Document what you design, preferably in a way that someone besides you
can understand. Describe not only what it is, but also what it's for.
Anyone who's taken a tour through a data book for a modern VGA graphics
controller can appreciate this. Better yet, include some real (that is,
actually compiled, run, and debugged) source code that uses your design.
Keep the documentation available even after you stop selling the part.
Make the documentation easy to get—and free.
</p></li><li><p>
Avoid timing dependencies. Any synchronous protocol or continuous input
data stream is an exception of course, but even there you can help by
providing a bit of buffering in your hardware. Putting a 5-million
transistor 225 MHz screamer into an interrupts-disabled spin loop waiting
for a few microseconds to pass before writing to the floppy controller
again due to some empirically observed resistance to being written faster
is not the best use of available MIPS.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id559614"></a>System Design</h3></div></div></div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Make physical RAM contiguous. It's just easier that way.
</p></li><li><p>
For multiprocessor systems, it's nice to be able to direct I/O
interrupts to different processors to distribute the load. Also, it's
nice to be able to turn off all I/O interrupts to all processors in a
single operation and to turn them back on later, while still allowing
interprocessor interrupts.
</p></li><li><p>
For CPUs, it would be nice to separate I/O interrupts from
interprocessor interrupts; having a different pin, a different interrupt
vector, and a different interrupt enable is ideal.
</p></li><li><p>
Resources that are duplicated across different parts of the system
should have support for synchronizing their state. For instance, the
PowerPC has a time base register and a pin for enabling it. Without that
pin (or without any means of actually controlling that pin), it's
impossible to ensure the time base register has the same value on all
processors.
</p></li><li><p>
For debugging, provide a means of doing a nonmaskable interrupt to all
processors, preferably from an optional switch, and also from a
software-accessible register. If this is a recoverable interrupt in the
CPU, all the better. This will make OS designers everywhere think of you
fondly every time the system locks up and they can push a button and get
to a kernel debugger.
</p></li><li><p>
Noncoherent caches aren't a good idea. A simple OS may be able to deal
with caches that aren't coherent with DMA accesses, but anything beyond
DOS or the maces will have major conniptions.
</p></li><li><p>
Plan for bugs. Leave a couple of I/O pins around to let you control a
PAL later, so you can do a quick turn on your design to fix the bug in
the new improved gizmo that replaces the no-longer-manufactured old gizmo.
</p></li><li><p>
Let the OS designer have one bit of visible I/O somewhere. A place for
a two-pin header where an LED can be hooked up will do. Alternatively,
provide a place to hook up a logic analyzer.
</p></li><li><p>
Expansion buses should be self configuring (for example, NuBus) or
software configurable (for example, PCI). For an example of how not to do
this, see ISA, SCSI, or IDE.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id559701"></a>Physical Design</h3></div></div></div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Make the case easy to open. See the Mac IIci for an example.
</p></li><li><p>
Put upgradable stuff where you can get at it. For an example of how not
to do this, try adding RAM to a Power Macintosh 8500.
</p></li><li><p>
Use the circuit board silk-screen for user documentation. If you've
made the mistake of requiring jumpers, describe the jumper options right
on the board.
</p></li><li><p>
If you must use jumpers, put an extra one or two on unused pins. Not
everyone lives ten minutes from Fry's Electronics.
</p></li><li><p>
Use the circuit board silk-screen to make it easier to debug or probe.
Label the chips with real names instead of "U24." Then tag every tenth
pin with its pin number. This helps anyone poking around with a scope
probe, and besides, its cool to personalize what that black plastic
behemoth is doing millions of times a second. While you're at it, label
some test points for clocks and interesting logic lines.
</p></li><li><p>
If you must use screws, use the same kind everywhere. If they must be
different lengths, at least make them the same thread. Make sure your
design holds together if any one given screw is missing, because that
screw always falls off the desk and takes a four-hour vacation somewhere.
</p></li><li><p>
Make it quiet. Otherwise, you can't use it while your spouse is
sleeping.
</p></li><li><p>
Avoid sharp edges. I hate bleeding on my motherboard.
</p></li><li><p>
Connectors should be keyed. If not, they WILL be plugged in backwards.
Lay out pins in connectors so that when they're plugged in backwards,
smoke doesn't appear.
</p></li><li><p>
Why is it that whenever I plug in the little twisted wire power LED,
it's always the wrong polarity? Label the pins, preferably with the wire
color that they're supposed to take. Alternatively, given the vagaries of
wire color selection by LED vendors, label the pins minus and plus, and
I'll just assume that the black wire goes to minus.
</p></li><li><p>
If it's different, use a different connector. I'm sure many parallel
printers have been plugged into the SCSI ports on the back of Macintoshes
everywhere. And in ancient times, 9-pin monitor cables were plugged into
serial ports.
</p></li><li><p>
If it's different, make it obvious that it's different. Can you tell
the difference between a 3.5-volt DIMM and a 5- volt DIMM? Why aren't
they labeled? For that matter, why aren't SIMMs and DIMMs labeled in the
first place? Not everyone knows how to read DRAM part numbers.

Hardware designers who read this article may react defensively and start

A minor update to last week's newsletter—the DR9 <code class="function">system_time()</code>
function will return the number of microseconds since boot, not the
number since January 1, 1970. We decided that it's important to have a
monotonically increasing <code class="function">system_time()</code> value even across changes to the
system's real time clock. You can calculate the number of microseconds
since January 1, 1970, by using the ANSI C <code class="function">time()</code> function and the
boot_time field in the system_info structure.

Believe it or don't, I'm actually writing this article under DR9.
Hiroshi's StyledEdit is on my desktop along with cool DriveSetup, Disks,
and Trash icons. "NuBar" hangs at the top, keeping track of applications
and windows, Pavel's DigitalClock sticks seconds in the recessed right
corner.
</p><p>
Over all, Doctor Nine is looking pretty good. (They sure added a lot of
stuff.) The QA Queen has called this the "Release from Hell." When the QA
Queen speaks, she speaks the Truth. Weeks went by while the file system
collapsed beneath me. I'd step into Dominic's doorway, my figure
reflected in the window in the wall. With a glance and a toss of his
hair, he'd turn to me and inquire, "Spinning forever?" But hey, what's a
file system if you can't start 8 to 10 cp's of tar files, xvf them as
they arrive in a new directory, then gzip the lot and chop it into 1k
pieces. Hey dude, double indirect this. And isn't everyone going to be
running the mvaawhile shell script, renaming said folder to aa, bb, cc,
dd, ee, ff, on to zz and back to aa to start all over?
</p><p>
Swap space is your friend.
</p><p>
One by one the big bugs got squashed, Dominic and I became virtual
lovers, but then the new file system stabilized, and we started seeing
other people.
</p><p>
See, I'm not happy unless something's breaking.
</p><p>
Robert Chinn, the King of the Underpinnings, spearheaded the
transformation of the top-secret BeLabs II, which now sports new
supports. Baby Macs and Daddy Macs are backed by BeBoxes with cereal for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Me? How could I live without post-its?
</p><p>
It's pretty much round-the-clock here. We know you want it, our software
hardens your hardware and all. We're thinking ahead. Big files, lots of
RAM, cheap hard drives, flaky video cards, network throughput,
partitions. You wanna build servers, games, interactive
cross-pollinational subfactories for new world estates. You want to Be in
charge, you don't want to wait. We will feed your need.
</p><p>
This is a Revolution, dammit.<br />
We're not building the OK-OS.
</p><p>
Tomorrow morning (Monday) I become the Build King, and with a keystroke
sequence built by Ming (whose name, curiously, is King with an M). I'll
install and test the BeOS on every family of PowerPC-based machine we
support. Then my Queen will ask for a report. Then I'll get lunch. Then
I'll show Cyril the VM deadlock thing, show Steve and Cyril the
dropping_notification thing, try to find the end of the benoit_rainbow on
this mouse_down thing, and the funny thing is, they know what I'm talking
about and you don't.
</p><p>
:)
</p><p>
As Bob Herold pointed out once, it's a strange and secret language we
speak here at Be, but keep your fingers crossed, don't settle for less
than what you love, raise your hands and lower your fingers and believe
there is a team of brilliant engineers slaving tonight to bring you what
you need.
</p><p>
The BeOS, a fresh, modern, carbon-fiber Operating System.
</p><p>
We'll talk again halfway to Macworld.

DR9, DR9, DR9!!!
</p><p>
Let's see. How easy or difficult is it going to be to move to DR9? Any
time I mention C++ nasties, I get some sort of response from someone.
Last week was no exception. One response to my statements about the
introduction of const was that things will be safer, another response was
a developer telling be how annoying const is and that they finally
learned how to cast it away. Also with the virtual destructor business,
on the one hand making virtual destructors makes things safer, on the
other, it bloats class frameworks. The answer is, get yourself one of
those "Effective C++" books or the "C++ FAQs" book. These books are
invaluable to the beginning and very experienced C++ developer. If you
read a snippet every day, you'll find yourself saying "Oh, that's why
that happens." DR9 shows much improvement in safety and stability. A lot
of this has to do with much tighter C++ coding practices. If you're
coming from DR8, you'll notice new compiler warnings where your code
previously didn't generate any.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">KeyDown</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">bytes</code>, <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">keyCode</code>)
</pre><p>
If you overrode this in DR8, you probably had
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">MyView</code>::<code class="methodname">KeyDown</code>(<span class="type">long</span> <code class="parameter">keyCode</code>)
</pre><p>
In DR9 this will generate a warning. Something about you overriding
something similar. This isn't strictly an error, but your KeyDown will
not get called! This is one of those "subtle" differences. After you
ignore our release notes for DR9, and just try to compile your code,
you'll come back here and read these words:
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id560062"></a>Ignore Compiler Warnings At Your Peril</h3></div></div></div><p>
Compiler warnings are your friends and will make for safer hex. The more
you fix, the safer your code will be, and you won't be staring at a
debugger window more than your running application.
</p><p>
DR9, DR9, DR9...
</p><p>
Ah, a stable release. We've got to have apps, we've got to have apps! Ah,
there's Fred Fish and his GNU efforts. Boy oh boy, look at all those
little command-line tools. Well, at least we have autoconf and m4. Now
it's much easier to recompile the rest of that world. Dominic is a POSIX
fool, and he did quite a lot to make sure the file system was quite POSIX
looking. There are other additions to the OS that make it even more POSIX
compatible, so it would behoove you to go out and get the "POSIX
Programmer's Guide" if you're so inclined. This thick purple book from
O'Reilly &amp; Associates should give you all the information you want to
know about POSIX. We aren't a UNIX system, but it sure doesn't hurt to
implement the various POSIX calls so that it's easier for people to write
apps.
</p><p>
I want to compile! I need the IDE! Oh well, I'll use vim for now. Ahh,
the IDE has shown up, and it does Java! Oh boy, Oh boy.
</p><p>
Let's see, first I'll do Tcl, then I'll do another rev of the imaging
thing:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/lib/imaging_dr9.tgz
</p><p>
This one does fast scaling as well as the bilinear stuff. And then
another rev of the yags library to add the spline support:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/lib/yags_dr9.tgz
</p><p>
And how about that zip and unzip thing. And what about a new tvtuner?
Say, what's that FireWire board doing in here? Oh, wait a minute, I hear
something... Yasmin sounds like she's waking up... Just one more compile,
just one more compile! OK, OK, we'll go to the store and buy your
birthday cake, sorry I forgot. Here's a sandbox to boot. All right, we'll
give you a party next weekend, now can I port some more?
</p><p>
Oh yeah, sister-in-law's engagement party, relatives visiting, water the
grass, put the pool cover on.
</p><p>
I like this DR9 thing. I want to port that treeview code. Oh, look,
there's a hierarchical view widget included with DR9? Well, how about
some sound code.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/sndutil_dr9.tgz
</p><p>
And what about that scrappy little MPEG-1 decoder? Can't you make it a
little bit more encapsulated so that multiple MPEGs can be played at
once? And why don't you throw a real interface on it while you're at it.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/mpeg_play_dr9.tgz
</p><p>
OK, it's 2:30 am Monday, time to go to bed, you can play some more
tomorrow. With features like a real working <code class="function">fork()</code> instead of <code class="function">spoon()</code>,
and a <code class="function">system()</code> call that returns the proper values, DR9 is shaping up to
be quite the solid citizen. If you play safe and follow the rules, not
only will your apps be wonderful and wise, but they'll probably run
faster to boot. The Developer Conference is quickly approaching, and I'm
quite beside myself with anticipation. Between now and then, we have a
belated birthday party, some major application porting, and some demo
apps to write. This is definitely a must-attend event. See you at the
front.

Windows are passeé, said an Apple scientist about twelve years ago. The
Mac was painfully taking flight right after the Lisa "Spruce Goose." I
thought reports of the demise of windows were a tad premature. I even
thought it was foolish.
</p><p>
I wasn't buying the story that the Mac (or PC) desktop had to mimic my
desk, but I thought windows were a really nice way to separate contexts
and to move them around. Windows, I thought, fulfilled a durable need
and, like the wheel, once invented were there to stay. I still believe
this—and more, as we say in my adopted country. What we could call the
classical way of UI evolution seems to have entered the era of
diminishing returns. As I type this, I remember the original MacWrite
with its simple menu bar. I use 1992 vintage Word 5.1a (on a PPC machine
running both BeOS and Mac software); Word 6 is frowned upon at Be, unless
used to demonstrate Virtual Mac performance under stress. On Word 5.1,
much more screen area is taken by tool and menu bars than in the original
Mac word processors. It gets worse on Word 6 and, on Windows Office 97,
one can end up with a debauchery of tool bars and palettes. In fairness,
you can go in and remove enough tool bars to go back to 94-95 levels. In
the industry, the joke is, by the year 2000, the screen area left for the
actual meat of the document will be the size of a first class $1.50
e-mail stamp. Joke or not, there is an uneasiness about UI paralleling
bloatware on the hard drive.
</p><p>
There is hope. Netscape is demonstrating versions of its future client,
Constellation, parts of which will soon surface in Netcaster. Sliding
panes and tiles smoothly slide in and out of view, allowing better use of
screen and desktop space and reducing the anxiety and confusion arising
from poorly presented access to huge volumes of local or remote
information. Windows, as units of context, are still present, but in a
streamlined, less obtrusive form. To a more modest extent, this is the
case with Explorer 4 in its platform preview incarnation. The UI can be
set to a classical Windows 95/NT style, or it can deviate from it in
varying degrees, including going to a one-click Web-style document
opening. On the desktop, "raw" borderless Web documents can be exposed,
live or static. And they can be dragged around, under the rest of the
desktop, without annoyingly jumping on top. Still at an early stage,
parents strongly cautioned, but really a more promising UI exploration
than Bob.
</p><p>
The more interesting UI developments come from smaller, more creative
players. MetaTools, for instance. In products such as Goo, Kai Power
Tools, and Bryce, they show how windows as we knew them can vanish, how
mouse gliding can cause tools to appear and disappear, drawers to open
and close, how the use of translucent objects effectively reduces mental
clutter. Their next product, Soap, for cleaning digital or scanned
photos, offers such nice UI innovations for users who don't need
Photoshop. For the musically inclined, Eric Wenger, the author of Bryce,
has also written synthesis software with similarly innovative and
soon-to-be-classical UI tools.
</p><p>
On this topic, I have two hopes. One is I'll get mail pointing to all the
products I obviously should have looked at long ago. The other is that
our new platform will be seen as a fertile field for the development of
the next generation of innovative UI elements.
