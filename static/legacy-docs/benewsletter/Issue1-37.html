Not much has been disclosed about the internals of the kernel scheduler.
It's time to explain in detail how it works, so that real-time
application programmers know what they can expect from it and can make
better use of it. In this article, I discuss the kernel scheduler as it
has been implemented since Developer Release 7.
</p><p>
The scheduler distinguishes between two classes of threads:
"time-sharing" and "real-time." The thread's priority level determines
which category it falls into. The priority range 1-99 is used for
time-sharing threads; 100-120 is used for real-time threads. Within each
class, threads are further differentiated using their relative priorities.
</p><p>
A real-time thread is executed as soon as it's ready. If more than one
real-time thread is ready at the same time, the thread with the higher
priority is executed first. The thread is guaranteed to run without being
preempted (except by a real-time thread with a higher priority) until it
invokes a blocking system call (semaphore, ports, snooze, I/O, and so on).
</p><p>
A time-sharing thread is executed only if there are no real- time threads
in the ready queue. When this condition is satisfied, a time-sharing
thread is elected in a probabilistic manner based on its priority, using
a logarithmic scale of base 2. For example, a thread with a priority 8 is
four times more likely to be elected than a thread with a priority 6. A
new time-sharing thread is reelected regularly, once every "scheduler
quantum" (currently, every 3 milliseconds).
</p><p>
Because the BeBox is a multiprocessor machine, things are actually a bit
more complex. But the rules described still apply: No time-sharing thread
is allowed to stand in the way of a real-time thread. For example, if CPU
1 is executing real-time thread A, it's possible for a time-sharing
thread B to run on CPU 2. (Note that on a single-processor system, B
would have to wait until A blocks.) If real-time thread C wakes up, it
would immediately interrupt B on CPU 2 and run there, without interfering
with A.
</p><p>
If you look at the header file OS.h (in DR8), you will see some
predefined priorities. With each real-time priority, there's an
associated "maximum latency" (described in the comment next to each
priority constant). This latency is the maximum time that a thread can
afford to sit in the ready queue without being executed. Note that these
maximum latencies are *not* enforced by the scheduler—these are
guidelines, not guarantees. As a developer, you can use the latency
guidelines to find the appropriate priority for your real-time thread.
</p><p>
In the real-time class:
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_REAL_TIME_PRIORITY</code> (120)—latency 0.5-1 ms Used for the most
demanding real-time tasks, such as audio. We currently use this one for
the threads in the chain feeding the DAC.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_URGENT_PRIORITY</code> (110)—latency 5-10 ms Used for slightly less
demanding tasks. We use it for MIDI.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_REAL_TIME_DISPLAY_PRIORITY</code> (100)—latency 10-30 ms We use this one
for the app_server threads poller and mouser, in charge of reading the
keyboard and displaying the cursor.
</p><p>
In the time-sharing class:
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_URGENT_DISPLAY_PRIORITY</code> (20) We don't use this one yet. You shouldn't
use it either.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_DISPLAY_PRIORITY</code> (15) This is the priority of window threads, where
updates take place.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_NORMAL_PRIORITY</code> (10) This is the priority of all other system-created
threads.
</p><p>
<code class="constant">B_LOW_PRIORITY</code> (5) This is for threads that run in the background,
without disturbing any other threads.
</p><p>
When designing a real-time application, analyze its real- time
constraints. If the maximum tolerable latency falls below 0.5
milliseconds, then the BeBox isn't (yet) the right platform for that
application. However, for anything higher than that, you should pick the
priority with the matching latency.
</p><p>
Real-time threads must limit themselves to operations that truly require
real-time attention. A healthy respect for this rule is essential to the
proper behavior of the system. Memory allocation, for example, should be
done by a normal priority time-sharing thread. The real-time thread
should only access buffers that have already been allocated (and locked
in memory, if necessary).
</p><p>
Another factor to keep in mind when composing your real-time thread is
whether a particular function call will "lock" the underlying system
resource or component. Most of the components of the <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™ are
reentrant, and so calls on that component can be used in a real-time
application. But some components aren't reentrant; functions that access
these components are automatically locked while they're being used. This
can degrade performance. For example, the file system (in its current
state) may lock the I/O system for long periods. This can be a problem
for certain real- time applications as we cannot guarantee reasonable
latency for disk I/O. We're quite aware of these limitations and are
constantly working to eliminate them.
</p><p>
If you run into any problem while designing or programming your real-time
application, or if you have a question, you can contact me at

In addition to being a full-time student at Michigan State University,
I'm a computer support assistant for the department of physics and
astronomy. My areas of study, astrophysics and computer engineering,
afford many opportunities to work on a wide variety of projects. Within
the astronomy group alone you can find a number of application areas,
ranging from control of telescopes to data acquisition.
</p><p>
The platforms I choose, both personally and departmentally, must contain
a highly responsive operating system. They must be able to multitask
effortlessly and be fully compatible with a wide range of hardware. The
Be systems and BeOS serve these purposes well—although there's always
room for expansion.
</p><p>
The BeBox's potpourri of technologies displays something I've been
expecting for years: The convergence of multiplatform technology to
achieve a heightened level of functionality. Very few machines come ready
with a <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™ and other such innovations integrated into the OS. I
see great potential, and I hope to utilize these features to their full
extent.
</p><p>
My short term plans include using a BeBox in a mass data acquisition and
control system. This system includes simultaneous information input and
control output according to a set of preprogrammed equations and
instructions. Long-term plans include MIDI sequencing, among other
things.
</p><p>
I think that Be is doing a great job of not getting caught in the typical
"developer shunning" that other computer hardware and software firms have
gotten into. Companies like Commodore, NeXT, and others made a great
debut, but they weren't responsive to the tides of an ever-changing world.

Not all the news was good at Macworld. One disturbing item was the
announcement by Apple's senior management that their CHRP (Common
Hardware Reference Platform) boxes would ship later than expected --
probably by the fourth quarter of 1997. This is bad news for the PowerPC
family. But the extent of the delay might trigger a healthy reaction and
end up creating a sense of urgency, finally, for a much needed standard
hardware platform, for an equivalent to the PC/AT for the PowerPC.
</p><p>
The concept of a reference platform isn't new or difficult. We all saw
the birth and the growth of a huge industry based on derivatives of IBM's
PC/AT design. When IBM transmogrified its RS processor family into the
PowerPC, it published a PowerPC Reference Platform design. We used PREP
as the basis for the design of the BeBox, adding multiprocessing and
richer I/O not explicitly envisioned by the platform designers, probably
because of their corporate roots in the PC business. This was in 1994.
</p><p>
Where are we two years later? Not much further along. Motorola, Apple,
and IBM got together and transformed PREP into CHRP. Basically, this was
done in order to make room in the platform definition for Macintosh
compatibility. This complicated things a little and there were other
issues related to the commitment of silicon vendors to making building
blocks for CHRP, but with a champion the size of Apple, CHRP had to be a
success.
</p><p>
It's now transpiring that Apple's commitment to CHRP was perhaps less
total than formerly trumpeted. Such tepid engagement might be connected
to the success of Power Computing. In the eyes of some, Power Computing
and others could take away large portions of the hardware business if
CHRP became a true industry platform. CHRP could threaten Apple's current
control of its licensing business.
</p><p>
Today, Apple's licenses are not licenses in the commonly accepted sense
of the term. You don't get a license to the Mac OS in the same sense as
getting a license to run Windows or UNIX on your PC clone. In the PC
world, unless you're really stupid or crazy and as long as you stick to
some basic hardware rules, you design a motherboard, you buy your BIOS
from a specialist such as AMI, Phoenix, or Award, and Windows runs on
your PC without any special interaction with the system software
supplier, Microsoft. For an Apple licensee, it's different. For each
motherboard design, Apple designs proprietary ASICs (roughly equivalent
to a chipset in the Wintel world) and adapts the Mac ROMs (the rough
equivalent of a BIOS) to the hardware. Then the Mac OS and applications
can run, ignoring hardware particulars. In the Apple cloning world, the
licensee gets a license to a motherboard design, permission to buy ASICs
and ROMs, and a Mac OS distribution license. I might oversimplify a
little here and there, but you get the picture: The Apple licensee needs
much more than the Mac OS from Apple. Without access to ROMs and ASICs,
you can't build a clone.
</p><p>
For those confronting the Byzantine world of Apple licensing, CHRP
promised to be a welcome simplification. But not a total one. The CHRP
spec still stipulated that Mac OS specific ROMs be purchased from Apple
(or from a designated vendor). Today, Apple can modify its hardware
almost at will. In theory, by controlling both the hardware and the
software, it can move the platform forward, incorporate new technology
more easily, and in the process, produce a better-integrated, smoother,
more reliable product. Apple's control of the hardware and software
layers might yield another byproduct when fine-tuning control of the
company's licensing business. While I'm not intimately familiar with the
terms of its licenses, I can imagine a situation where a licensee does
not get a license to a new design and the required ASIC and ROM building
blocks, or not right away, or not automatically.
</p><p>
Perhaps CHRP was perceived as a threat to Apple's ability to control
licensees, and Power Computing's striking success might have given weight
to the fear. As a result, CHRP- compliant hardware and software got
delayed, thus threatening the advent of a truly standard PowerPC platform.
</p><p>
Hopefully, Apple's new management realizes the importance of creating
such a standard. But we know that management fiats rarely accelerate
existing projects. The way out might be to just ditch CHRP. It was
getting unconvincing or unconvinced support from the other players
anyway. Take any reasonable current or imminent hardware design, call it
nCHRP or whatever, and make it easy or easier to buy the ASICs and ROMs
-- as easy as it is to buy a chipset and a BIOS in the Wintel world. Of
course, it's easier said than done, and the transition to a true platform
might feel threatening. But no one's business or credibility will be
helped by a failure to deliver a standard PowerPC platform in 1997.

The "what's in /?" thread veered into a UNIX (pro or con) shouting

A previous request for FireWire to support a multiheaded system was

At what level of the OS/driver world would you insert the intelligence
to support a 90 degree pivotable monitor? Should the BeOS and hardware
be "open" so a third-party could provide an implementation directly?
Alternatively, should Be provide indirect hooks? Following the latter,
it was suggested that the OS should provide hooks for arbitrary display
sizes and orientations. It was also pointed out that intelligent
switching between portrait and landscape layout requires a driver (or
some part of software) that can move windows so they stay on the screen.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id495192"></a>Subject: Spaces in Filenames</h4></div></div></div><p>
It was proposed that spaces in filenames be converted to underbars when
the name is displayed in a shell. This would (it was opined) make the
life of the CLI user a wee bit nicer. The proposal was fairly
unanimously rejected; tempers flared.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id495208"></a>Subject: Case Sensitive File Names</h4></div></div></div><p>
Or "When is an 'a' not an 'A'?" Should filenames be case sensitive?
Many opinions here. Well, actually, only three opinions: "Yea," "nay,"
and "sometimes." But lots of mail. LOTS of mail. (Uhm... is "lots" the
same as... nevermind.)
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id495223"></a>Subject: An Alternative View</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Persistent Object Store as Filesystem</h5></div></div></div><p>
This thread was sprouted from the case sensitivity debacle. To squeeze
a number of its ideas together the argument goes something like this:
Files should be replaced by database- managed objects that would be
accessed through queries and that would be visible at the programming
level AND the user level. The boundary between a document and the
application(s) that can open it would be intentionally blurred.
</p><p>
There was some grumbling (How are existing foreign file systems
supported? Will programmers *really* be able to throw away their file
system crutches and walk? If the result is hierarchical, how is it
different from the file system?), but, in general, there was little
objection to the object/document metaphor.

After a shaky start (Tangerine Dream? Let's all go to Izzy's house,
turn on the black lights, and imagine we're at the edge of the
universe.) this thread became a clearing house for "audio jukebox"
ideas. Such a device could use IR or the GeekPort to search through and
play tracks from a stack of CDs (or, in the future, DVDs).

Windows recognizes .SCR; the Mac knows After Dark. How about a Be
screen saver format and API? It was pointed out that you can run screen
