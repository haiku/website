This article discusses certain design issues of <span class="application">Terminal</span>, the terminal
emulator for BeOS, and related matters.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id608055"></a>GUI Versus Command Line</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are two ways to interact with BeOS. The first is apparent from the
moment the system boots: Take the mouse and click on the pretty pictures.
This allows the beginner to use the system immediately. For advanced
users, however, the point-and-click routine becomes tedious, resulting in
such "impure" features as keyboard accelerators.
</p><p>
The second way to interact with BeOS takes the keyboard accelerator
concept to the logical conclusion: Dispense with the mouse, and use the
keyboard only. This happens when you start the Be app
called <span class="application">Terminal</span>. It
reads a line of text &gt;from the keyboard, and interprets it according to
well-defined rules.
</p><p>
Real-world users rely on a mix of these two approaches: The painting
program needs a file name (which you type), while <span class="application">Terminal</span> users can
construct new command lines by cutting-and-pasting.
</p><p>
The Posix-compliance of BeOS is not merely a crutch to allow developers
to port archaic programs. The persistence of UNIX-like systems, and the
accompanying terminal emulators, shows the attraction and power of
expressing your computational desires in a symbolic way. From a
contributor to the "fortune" command:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words—but only
those to describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10K
words can be adequately described with pictures.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
GUI fanatics are free to send me a picture of this quotation!
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id608115"></a>Plumbing</h3></div></div></div><p>
Terminal is mistakenly considered a monolithic application that reads and
processes commands. It is actually one of several modular components,
which can be recombined in useful ways. Of chief interest is the "shell",
to use the UNIX terminology. The shell is a program which reads a command
line, parses it, and then executes another program to do the work. The
<code class="filename">/bin</code> directory contains many
useful commands, familiar to UNIX users. The
shell shipped by Be is "bash", but is easily replaced at the user's
whimsy.
</p><p>
Here are some BeOS configurations:
</p><pre class="screen">
bash &lt;-&gt; pty &lt;-&gt; Terminal &lt;-&gt; AppServer &lt;-&gt; keyboard/screen

bc &lt;-&gt; pty &lt;-&gt; Terminal &lt;-&gt; AppServer &lt;-&gt; keyboard/screen

bash &lt;-&gt; pty &lt;-&gt; NetServer &lt;-&gt; network card

bash &lt;-&gt; serial driver &lt;-&gt; serial port
</pre><p>
The first configuration applies when you double-click the <span class="application">Terminal</span> icon,
or type "Terminal" to the shell. The second applies if you type "Terminal
/bin/bc", which starts the "bc" desk calculator instead of a shell. A
command other than "bc" may be specified, of course. The third applies if
you connect to your BeOS machine from the network: You must enable
"telnet" service in Network preferences. The last configuration will be
supported in the next release, and permits remote logins from a serial
device, such as a modem.
</p><p>
The pseudo-tty driver, "pty", serves the same purpose as that in the UNIX
world. Both "pty" and the serial driver provide uniform services in the
area of low-level character handling. This handling is programmable using
the "termios" family of functions, described in any Posix manual. From
the shell, use the "stty" command: Type "stty—help" for help.
</p><p>
Note that the shell is usable in a non-interactive setting, reading
commands from a file. This scripting ability is enhanced by its built-in
programming primitives. Look at
<code class="filename">/system/boot/Bootscript</code> for an example. A
"shell command file" can be started from the <span class="application">Tracker</span> just like any Be
app. The "bash" manual gives exhaustive details about shell programming.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id608194"></a>Termcap And Curses</h3></div></div></div><p>
UNIX pioneered the notion of describing the characteristics and abilities
of standalone terminals, a.k.a. glass TTYs. There was a plentiful
assortment in the 70s and 80s, with differences that could best be
described as gratuitous. The publicly assembled file, stored in
<code class="filename">/etc/termcap</code>, allowed programs like text editors and games to move the
cursor all over the screen, without knowing the particular brand of
incompatible tty being used.
</p><p>
This file is shipped with the BeOS, and comes in handy when you want to
run "vi" or "emacs" locally in a Terminal window. It is also needed if
you log into a BeOS system from Solaris, or from that VAX VMS system with
the TeleVideo.
</p><p>
The BeOS will also ship with "ncurses", a powerful library built on
termcap, and used by many terminal-oriented programs. This is based on
the "curses" library of BSD UNIX.
</p><p>
In the 90s, most terminal manufacturers have departed the business (or
this world). The market remains for terminal emulators, such as ProComm,
Kermit, xterm of X Windows, and all UNIX workstation consoles. Be's
Terminal app falls in this category. All follow the loosely-defined ANSI
X3.64 standard.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id608238"></a>Character Sets</h3></div></div></div><p>
The character set used by Terminal is 8-bit. The appearance is determined
by the font selected by the user—usually some approximation of ASCII,
or ISO Latin1 for Europeans. The BeOS supports 16-bit Unicode, but the
design impact on Terminal is undecided. The BeOS has selected the Unicode
byte encoding called UTF-8. The ASCII character set is 7-bit, and maps
one-to-one onto UTF-8. However, bytes in the range 0x80–0xFF start a
multi-byte UTF representation of a Unicode character. This conflicts with
8-bit character sets, like Latin1.
</p><p>
This is only one example of the conflict between Terminal's mandate to
faithfully emulate the past, and the desire to keep one foot in the
present.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id608255"></a>ANSI Compatibility</h3></div></div></div><p>
The ANSI standard defines some aspects of terminal behavior, such as the
effects of various escape sequences. The standard is too vague to
implement a working emulator; the successor standard, ISO 6429, is
similarly deficient. For example, cursor behavior at end-of-line is
undefined: A program cannot know whether to expect line truncation, line
wrap, or a flashing blue screen.
</p><p>
Instead, writers of "ANSI" emulation must rely on existing TTYs, such as
the old VT family from DEC, or other emulators. This is much better than
the free-for-all in past decades, but is still aggravating for users.
</p><p>
The problem is not solved by termcap. Observe that you can use "telnet"
in <span class="application">Terminal</span> to log into a remote
system. <code class="filename">/etc/termcap</code> on the BeOS is not
used in this case. If the other system has termcap support, you can
transfer the "ANSI BeBox Terminal" entry to the remote system. Otherwise,
you must cross your fingers and claim to be "vt100", "linux", "xterm", or
some such.
</p><p>
The best approach would be for <span class="application">Terminal</span> to emulate several well-known
commercial products, allowing the user to make whatever claim that works
for the remote system. Needless to say, this is an arduous task.
</p><p>
Further complications arise in the keyboard department. The existing
standards say nothing about keyboard layout, or the characters and escape
sequences to be sent by those keys. The current situation is one of
bewildering variety. Many emulators have programmable keys, but this only
places the burden on the user.
</p><p>
The current goal is to have Terminal emulate all useful aspects of the
DEC VT220. A large fraction of these capabilities have already been
implemented.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id608322"></a>Text Selection</h3></div></div></div><p>
Like every good Be app, <span class="application">Terminal</span> provides access to the system-wide
clipboard, allowing text to be copied and pasted. The usual menu method
and keyboard accelerations are employed.
</p><p>
For users with a 2-button mouse, the rightmost button will paste text
from the clipboard. As a further shortcut, if the window contains
selected text, this text, rather than the clipboard, will be pasted.
</p><p>
Since the cursor can be moved anywhere on the screen, and overwrite any
portion, the definition of the "correct text" to copy and paste is
sometimes unknown. This is a problem for all terminals and emulators with
text retrieval ability. The usual route taken is to copy the text as it
appears on the screen, but that means tabs are replaced by spaces. It
also creates trouble for multi-line copies, where text may have been
wrapped.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id608358"></a>Character Attributes</h3></div></div></div><p>
The appearance of characters can be embellished by the use of
"attributes". <span class="application">Terminal</span>, for example, allows underlining, reverse video,
bold, background color, and foreground color. These attributes can be
combined freely, using the appropriate escape sequences. The permitted
colors are white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, cyan and magenta:
watch out for unreadable combinations!
</p><p>
When you start a new <span class="application">Terminal</span>, the
"Be" logo is generated using various
attributes: underline, bold, and color. Inspecting /etc/profile shows the
trick. The following command can be typed to the shell verbatim:
</p><pre class="screen">
echo -e "\nWelcome to the \033[1;4;34mB\033[1;4;31me\033[m shell.\n"
</pre><p>
The [-e] flag to the "echo" command allows binary bytes to be represented
with printable strings. So "\n" means ASCII Line Feed (octal 012), and
"\033" means ASCII Escape (octal 033). To enable the bold attribute, try
</p><pre class="screen">
echo -e "\033[1m"
</pre><p>
Then also enable a blue foreground with
</p><pre class="screen">
echo -e "\033[34m"
</pre><p>
Disable everything with
</p><pre class="screen">
echo -e "\033[m"
</pre><p>
Here is the complete list currently supported by <span class="application">Terminal</span>:
</p><pre class="screen">
1  bold
4  underline
7  reverse video
30 black foreground
31 red foreground
32 green foreground
33 yellow foreground
34 blue foreground
35 magenta foreground
36 cyan foreground
37 white foreground
40 black background
41 red background
42 green background
43 yellow background
44 blue background
45 magenta background
46 cyan background
47 white background
</pre><p>
Observe that no programming library like "curses", or any file like
<code class="filename">/etc/termcap</code>, is needed to use escape sequences. You can use these
embellishments in shell command files, or in C programs with <code class="function">printf()</code>. In
fact, all escape sequences are this simple to invoke.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id608458"></a>Resources</h3></div></div></div><p>
For those interested in other escape sequences supported by Terminal, and
terminals in general, the first file to peruse is
<code class="filename">/etc/termcap</code>. A man
page for "termcap" is needed to parse the entries, but a useful
description of ANSI-style escape sequences is included near the end of
the file.
</p><p>
Another excellent Internet resource is:
</p><p>
This contains a veritable trove of technical info, historical trivia,
selected discussions from Internet news groups, and test programs.
</p><p>
Last, and least, you can order ISO 6429 from
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ansi.org/">http://www.ansi.org/</a> for $130 or so. Save your money.

"Developers' Workshop" is a new weekly feature that provides answers to
our developers' questions. Each week, a Be technical support or
documentation professional will choose a question (or two) sent in by an
actual developer and provide an answer.
</p><p>
We've created a new section on our website. Please send us your
Newsletter topic suggestions by visiting the website at:
http://www.be.com/developers/suggestion_box.html.
</p><p>
Wow, time flies when you're working at Be! Two weeks between these
articles seems like mere minutes to me. So I had to take the scraper to
the walls of my brain to get together something to tell you about. But
first, this brief public service announcement...
</p><p>
We (Brian and I) have been working hard for the last couple of months to
bring you a new, improved, more responsive DTS. If you tried it before
and were disappointed with the response—or never got one—it's time
to try it again. Come one, come all! Fill out the Developer Tech Support
form in the Registered Developers Area. We are here to help. If we can't
solve your problems, we'll hunt down your favorite Be engineers and pry
the answers out of them.
</p><p>
DTS will become even more responsive as we move into 1998 with a new
addition to the team. I'll tell you who in two minutes—I mean two
weeks. Also, on the other side of the world, Be Europe has added a new
developer support engineer, Thijs Stalenhoef. The combined efforts of our
US and European DTS teams should serve you well as we move into the new
era of Intel support.
</p><p>
Thank you for that DTS news update, and now back to our regularly
scheduled program...
</p><p>
Speaking of lots to read, there is an incredible amount of information to
absorb when learning to program for a new OS. A lot of the hard-to-get
information about BeOS programming is hiding in back issues of the
Newsletter. For example, check out these gems about add-ons from the
not-too-distant past.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<a class="link" href="">
Be Engineering Insights: Writing Add-ons in C++ by Cyril Meurillon
</a>
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link" href="">
Be Engineering Insights: Shared Libraries And Add-Ons by Cyril
Meurillon
</a>
</p></li></ul><p>
So you've read Cyril's articles about how to create add-ons, and where to
put them depending on their use, and now you're actually going to try to
load an add-on:
</p><p>
"I put my add-ons in a folder called Effects that lives in my app's
directory. How do I load the add-ons from that folder?"
</p><p>
You can find the path to your app with...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="methodname">GetAppInfo</code>(<span class="type">app_info *</span><code class="parameter">info</code>) const;
</pre><p>
<span class="type">app_info</span> is a struct found in
<code class="filename">Roster.h</code>...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
struct <span class="type">app_info</span> {
             <code class="methodname">app_info</code>();
             <code class="methodname">~app_info</code>();

  <span class="type">thread_id</span>  <code class="varname">thread</code>;
  <span class="type">team_id</span>    <code class="varname">team</code>;
  <span class="type">port_id</span>    <code class="varname">port</code>;
  <span class="type">uint32</span>     <code class="varname">flags</code>;
  <span class="type">entry_ref</span>  <code class="varname">ref</code>;
  <span class="type">char</span>       <code class="varname">signature</code>[<code class="constant">B_MIME_TYPE_LENGTH</code>];
};
</pre><p>
Use <code class="code"><code class="varname">app_info</code>.<code class="varname">ref</code></code> to find the path to your app and its parent:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">app_info</span> <code class="varname">info</code>;
<code class="classname">BPath</code> <code class="varname">path</code>;
<code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetAppInfo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">info</code>);
<code class="classname">BEntry</code> <code class="varname">entry</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">info</code>.<code class="varname">ref</code>);
<code class="varname">entry</code>.<code class="methodname">GetPath</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">path</code>);
<code class="varname">path</code>.<code class="methodname">GetParent</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">path</code>);
</pre><p>
To add the Effects folder to the path use <code class="methodname">BPath::Append()</code>.
<code class="methodname">Append()</code> takes a
relative path string and adds it to the current path:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">path</code>.<code class="methodname">Append</code>("Effects");
</pre><p>
Now create a <code class="classname">BDirectory</code> using
<code class="methodname">BPath::Path()</code>. You can cruise through the
directory and try to load each file:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BDirectory</code> <code class="varname">dir</code>( <code class="varname">path</code>.<code class="methodname">Path</code>() );

This Monday's December 8th New York Times had a story in its Business
section bemoaning the trouble with competing Web browsers. It reminded me
of a conversation I once had, about 15 years ago, with a dinner guest at
our house back in France...
</p><p>
We are sitting on the sofa, ready to watch the 8 p.m. newscast,
uninterrupted by commercials in those blessed days. As a result, we get a
fairly heavy dose of TV ads right before the male or female anchor starts
telling us what to think.
</p><p>
On the screen, a Pampers commercial. The guest mutters words to the
effect it's awful, I mechanically acquiesce. He keeps going and I
suddenly realize he isn't protesting the aesthetics of the ad. What's the
trouble? There too many brands of diapers, he grumbles. By now, I'm fully
awakened from my TV stupor. If that's the case, who will decide how many
and which brands? Us, he replies...
</p><p>
I forgot to mention the distinguished guest was both a psychoanalyst and
a communist, and still is, I'm afraid. By us, he meant the Party or some
Committee or Directorate in charge of diapers. The discussion didn't go
very well.
</p><p>
Fifteen years later, reading the NYT story didn't go very well either. In
essence, the writer described the trouble besetting us poor Web users
because two browsers were not exactly compatible. Some sites even had the
nerve of demanding you download IE 4.0 before being allowed to enjoy the
riches they contain. Thankfully, the story stated this happened only in a
small minority of cases.
</p><p>
Well, yes, it's a problem when the browser and the site don't agree
completely, or at all. But who's going to decide how many browser we
have, and which ones? Do we have too many browsers, or too few? To which
the sophisticated reader might reply this situation arises because we
don't have a Web standard or, if we have one, because the big players,
Microsoft and Netscape, don't give a damn and are trying to increase
their profits by generating a standard they'd control to their advantage.
</p><p>
There are many reasons not to let the apparatchiki decide for us how many
and which Web browsers we should use. The Web is too young, the
technology, the psychology and the sociology involved are far from being
understood well enough. We've seen what happens when politicians try to
legislate the contents of the Web. Do we want the same people who vote
the Pentagon budget to also legislate HTML dialects? Why not
microprocessor instruction sets? We've seen what happened with a
programming language, Ada, sanctioned by the DoD: No one uses it outside
of mandated applications.
</p><p>
This isn't an argument about standards, international or not. Who can
claim we don't need standards? But beware of the questions brooking no
disagreement. If there are only pros and no con, then it's a con. One Web
standard would make life much simpler, wouldn't it? Perhaps—as long as
standardization isn't premature, doesn't brutally stop the innovative
fermentation taking place while the technology is still young, or doesn't
allow anyone to own the standard and to create a profitable monopoly at
our expense.
</p><p>
Two browsers—only—is definitely a bad sign. Something or someone
has caused the Web to age prematurely and we should treasure the
remaining vitality still manifesting itself in experiments—and in a
little bit of confusion.
</p><p>
Of course, this assumes there is a "free market" at work for the Web
standards decisions, as in earlier programming language contentions. This
assumption is a weakness in my argument, one that might unfortunately
cause government bureaucrats to offer their help in repairing the broken
free-market process.
