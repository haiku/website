C++ makes programming applications fun and efficient through the use of
objects. Multithreading operating systems make computers more responsive
because applications can be divided into independent tasks. The mixing of
the two is natural in modern computers such as the BeBox.
</p><p>
In the programming model of the <span class="trademark">Be Operating System</span>™, applications
spawn threads that create and share global objects such as windows and
views. This is both very powerful and dangerous. The different threads of
an application are running simultaneously, and one of them may destroy a
shared object at any time. The other threads will keep trying to use the
destroyed object, which is problematic, unless special precautions are
taken. There are two solutions to the problem.
</p><p>
The first solution is to use unique IDs as object identifiers. The
validity of the object is checked whenever it is used, and an error is
returned if the object has been destroyed. It is then up to the thread to
deal with the error. Unfortunately, C++ uses pointers as object
identifiers, which aren't unique IDs as they may be recycled. This is
consequently not a solution that can be considered when programming for
the <span class="trademark">Be OS</span>™.
</p><p>
The second solution is somehow to synchronize the threads whenever a
shared object is destroyed. For example, one can think of a scheme where
threads receive a death notification, so that they can remember not to
use the object any more. This is the kind of solution that a Be developer
would adopt. Note that the implementation of such a scheme is the entire
responsibility of the developer. But here are a couple examples.
</p><p>
Let's start with the Database Kit. <code class="classname">BRecord</code> objects implicitly refer to
the <code class="classname">BDatabase</code> object associated with a volume. There is only one instance
of this <code class="classname">BDatabase</code> object per team, which is shared by all the threads of
the team. Everything is fine until the volume is unmounted. When this
happens, the main application thread is sent a synchronous notification
message, and then the <code class="classname">BDatabase</code> object is destroyed. But what about the
other threads of the team? If one tries to instantiate a <code class="classname">BRecord</code> given a
record_ref after the database has been destroyed, it is safe. The <code class="classname">BRecord</code>
constructor will simply report an error. A record_ref is a unique ID that
can be checked when a <code class="classname">BRecord</code> is created. But if the thread has already
created the BRecord object when the database is destroyed, then things
get more complicated. A <code class="classname">BRecord</code> object may stop functioning any time of
its life, because the underlying <code class="classname">BDatabase</code> object goes away. You can't
assume any <code class="classname">BRecord</code> method call will succeed, even after the object has
been created and the record read in. Errors must be checked and dealt
with absolutely everywhere. This makes programming especially difficult
and unpleasant—something C++ isn't supposed to be.
</p><p>
What's the solution? The Browser solves this problem in an interesting
way. When the main Browser thread receives an unmount notification, it
synchronously broadcasts it to all its windows. On reception of this
message, all the Browser window threads can safely dispose of <code class="classname">BRecord</code>s
associated with the volume going off-line. This ensures that a thread can
safely use a <code class="classname">BRecord</code> during each cycle through the event loop.
</p><p>
We see that great care should be taken. The only safe use of a <code class="classname">BRecord</code>
object is in the context of an event-driven thread. <code class="classname">BRecord</code> objects can't
be used in a thread that isn't event-driven (for example, a
compute-intensive thread), because the underlying <code class="classname">BDatabase</code> object may be
destroyed asynchronously.
</p><p>
Now let's consider the Application Kit. The <code class="classname">BLooper</code> object offers the
<code class="methodname">Lock()</code> and <code class="methodname">Unlock()</code>
methods so different threads can share an object
safely. Whenever a thread accesses a
<code class="classname">BLooper</code>, it must lock it. The thread
can unlock it when it is done with the access.
</p><p>
Let's imagine two threads, A and B, sharing a <code class="classname">BWindow</code> object (which
derives from <code class="classname">BLooper</code>). Thread A destroys the window and then thread B
wants to access it. B invokes the <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> method on the destroyed window
(note that <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> isn't a virtual function). The method invocation is
simply a function call. No virtual table lookup is necessary, which is
fortunate because the object doesn't exist any more. But you must admit
that the idea of invoking a method on an object that doesn't exist any
more is a little troublesome. The first thing that <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> does is to
safely check whether the 'this' pointer is a valid <code class="classname">BLooper</code> object. If it
isn't, <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> reports an error. If it is, <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> carefully locks the
object.
</p><p>
All this seems perfectly safe. But it isn't. <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> catches all cases of
invalid pointers. But what if the pointer becomes valid again? Pointers
aren't unique IDs, and one can reasonably think of a new window being
allocated at the same place as the old one. The new window would get
locked, while the thread wanted to lock the old one. We see that <code class="methodname">Lock()</code>
is successful at serializing all accesses to a shared <code class="classname">BLooper</code> as long as
the object isn't destroyed.
</p><p>
The solution, once again, is to synchronously broadcast a message to all
the threads of the team to notify tell them that the object has been
destroyed. This prevents the use of such objects in threads that aren't
event-driven, but allows safe sharing of objects among the different
threads.

The company I run, Mipsys, specializes in videoconferencing software and
industrial data acquisition and treatment. We also work with Echelon's
LonWorks field bus technology in industrial and building automation. We
do a lot of engineering development but we also produce products for
other companies and for Mipsys itself.

I first met Jean-Louis in the USA back in the early 1990s to talk about
"la pluie et le beau temps" [the rain and the good times]. A few minutes
later, I was very surprised to see him leave the room and come back with
an NDA (nondisclosure agreement).
</p><p>
I didn't want to have any confidential information at first, but
Jean-Louis insisted. So I signed up.
</p><p>
He showed me the BeBox project. I was very happy to see that most of the
best technologies were already in the machine, as well as some very smart
operating system features, such as multiprocessing, an integrated
database, and real-time capabilities.
</p><p>
Fourteen years ago, I started my computer life with the Apple II and I
remember how useful the joystick port was for small home or laboratory
experiments in many fields. So I offered to add some built-in data
acquisition capabilities. Jean-Louis immediately agreed to the idea. But
at that time, Be discontinued the Hobbit-based BeBox and started
redesigning the BeBox with PowerPC processors. By redesigning the
machine, it was now possible to include the <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™, a set of
parallel and analog input/output connections. Including the GeekPort in
the machine would allow any user to have all types of functionalities
that were particularly useful for home automation, laboratories, or geek
use!
</p><p>
Now that the hardware was going to be done directly by Be, Jean-Louis
called me and asked me to think about software to control the GeekPort.
</p><p>
I had been dreaming of software for home automation and independent geek
use for a long time. For years I had observed software evolving and
becoming more user-friendly, but it happened slowly. Just as the Mac OS
compared to its predecessors, I wanted something really more friendly.
This was certainly not easy either to imagine or to develop.
</p><p>
With the help of Raphael Moll and Olivier Coudert, Mipsys invented a new
software environment we named GeekPlayer. GeekPlayer is a special BeBox
software environment for easily developing applications that control all
kinds of experiments. We were the very first European developer to work
on the BeBox, and our whole team is proud of that, because we truly
believe the BeBox will become a widely used and useful computer. In this
adventure we always did the best we could. We appreciate this creative
and constructive way of doing business.
</p><p>
By joining BeBox developers you will certainly find one of the best ways
to create, invent, and do good work. I also encourage European developers
to participate actively and develop new original applications that take
advantage of the BeBox.
</p><p>
I benefit from writing this article to say that we work in the
videoconferencing field as well. If you are interested in working with
us, just call me or send me e-mail at mipsysad@imaginet.fr.
</p><p>
Have fun, and let the creative spirit be with you.
</p><p>
GeekPlayer will soon be available on the Net!

"What about Java? What do you think about it and what are your plans for
it?" I'm often asked these questions on-line and in person and this is a
place to begin answering them.
</p><p>
First, programming languages. I'm agnostic—or practical. Currency, for
me, is the big determinant. If the language is in wide circulation,
well-supported by toolsmiths, well-abused by programmers, I embrace it
wholeheartedly. Do you think C++ is lovable? Unless you're into SM
(Software Masochism), probably not. But it has currency. At this stage it
has become the lingua franca of our business—just as English has
become the world's communication vernacular. Do we think of BASIC as an
elegant language? In the old Sears and Roebuck sense of style, perhaps  --
I mean this in the comfortable, familiar, no-nonsense style of the old
catalog of tools. Microsoft understood this and were very clever in
making Visual Basic such a success.
</p><p>
I've been involved in decades of language arguments. Always interesting,
even more so if you understand my culture of birth, where we enjoy
nothing more than an intellectual argument—about wines or movies, or
about APL, ADA, and Pascal. We even have existentialist cab drivers. But
in the end, one set of circumstances or another, English colonies or Bell
Labs and UNIX give a language wide circulation and momentum.
</p><p>
So what about Java in this frame of reference? It's mostly good news. I
don't know if we should equate Sun with Bell Labs and, if I can twist the
metaphor a little bit, it looks like there is a revolt afoot against the
United Kingdom of Microsoft. I sense a great deal of the energy
propelling Java as being anti-Microsoft. It's probably unavoidable now
that Microsoft's size and power make the polarization easy, but it
shouldn't be confused with what Java does for programmers and users  --
even if one of Java's touted benefits is avoiding the dire consequences
of a one-standard world dominated by Microsoft. I come from a company
that made one great ad in 1984, introducing the Macintosh as a way to
break Big Brother IBM's domination. And yes, recently, some wags have
pasted Bill Gates' picture into the ad. Great ad, one of the greatest. It
only helps a little in a long, complex battle.
</p><p>
So what about Java itself and the strategy to make it the Web's C++? It
looks promising. Close to home, Metrowerks will ship Java tools on the
next CodeWarrior CD and there are several efforts afoot to write a Java
interpreter on the BeBox. The known limitations of Java are being
addressed. Just-in-time compilers will deal with some of the performance
issues, and enterprising programmers are already perverting the
"standard," producing deviant extensions. Just as with human languages,
barbarisms and neologisms are a sign of acceptance; people's desires are
channeled into it, unnatural acts result in a robust life form, as in the
Greek roots of the word "hybrid."
</p><p>
A few things remain to unfold. One of them is Sun's real plans. For many
years I have admired Sun's skills at ideological warfare, at getting
airtime, saying one thing and doing another. For instance, Sun has been
very good at preaching the open systems gospel. In the end they have a
proprietary offering of hardware and software, which they call an
industry standard. When I see them promoting Java as an industry standard
and announcing a little later they'll produce hardware to run Java really
well, I'm interested. Are they using their considerable persuasive powers
to promote a standard, channel into it the energy of many, with the
intent of controlling their own "better" version of it? Come to think of
it, isn't this the game Netscape plays with HTML and Navigator?
</p><p>
The other factor still to play out is Microsoft's OCX (OCs as they're
newly called, standing for OLE Controls), objects—or applets in the
Windows/OLE world. Now, Java's most compelling feature is
platform-independent distribution of applications over the Net, a very
attractive idea. What Microsoft will say is: OK, in theory you can do
that with Java (to the best of my knowledge, they still haven't executed
the letter of intent to license Java) for 100 percent of the machines
connected to the Net. But in practice, you can do that with OCs for 90
percent of the clients, without having to trade off simplicity or
performance for the other 10 percent. An interesting argument, one that
only reinforces the fears of Microsoft domination—but one that needs
consideration nonetheless.
</p><p>
Here at Be, we all look forward to the emergence of Java as a successful
independent standard, more like the Internet and C++, adopted by many and
controlled by no one.
