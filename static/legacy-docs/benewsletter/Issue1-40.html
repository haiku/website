An anonymous Be geek, alone with his computers, is reading comp.sys.be:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">The BeBox is a great machine... except for graphics card support which
is really miserable.</span>”
</p><p>
"Why is Be supporting only the 964 (which is no longer available), and
not the 968 (which is). I *know* they're almost identical..."
</p><p>
"Is Be so lazy that they can't even support the Matrox Millenium?"
</p><p>
Dagnabbit, these guys are right. What was Be thinking when they decided
to do such a bad job with graphics card support? I need to help them...
At least they had the intelligence to release the sources for the few
graphic drivers that they do provide. Let's see... here I have a Diamond
card based on a Vision S3 968, using VRAM. A pretty good card. Too bad
they don't support it. I never did a graphics driver before, but it's
probably no more difficult than any other piece of software.
</p><p>
I'll plug the card into my BeBox and turn the machine on. Uh oh, the
screen is black. No Be logo, nothing. That's strange. When I plugged this
card into my Wintel machine, everything just worked—I didn't even have
to copy a new driver onto my disk. Why can't I do the same thing here?
Wait... Of course! God, I'm stupid! The Wintel uses an 80x86 processor
which can execute the BIOS code of the ROM. The BeBox would need an
emulator to do the same thing, and that's not such an easy job.
</p><p>
But it's not a big deal. I have the source from Be for a 964-based board.
I just need the databook of the 968... Here it is.
</p><p>
[Be geeks are extremely resourceful.]
</p><p>
Great, they explain the differences between the 968 and the 964—just
what I need. This should be an easy job.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497134"></a>Friday, 10:28 pm</h3></div></div></div><p>
Tarnation! Still nothing! All the settings look good, but the screen is
still completely black. What could be wrong? I'm using the TVP 3026
RAMDAC/clock generator; the Be driver uses the TVP 3025. That's probably
close enough—but maybe I should check to see if they're really
compatible. I should have those databooks somewhere... Here. OK, let's
compare everything...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497152"></a>Friday, 10:51 pm</h3></div></div></div><p>
Fuor la spada! These guys are completely crazy! They rename or move half
of the registers, and half of the others were completely modified. No
wonder nothing worked. Probably I can try to patch the code used to
program the TVP 3025...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497167"></a>Saturday, 12:04 am</h3></div></div></div><p>
Okay, now I'm making progress. There are still huge bugs in the graphic
settings, but at least the screen isn't black anymore, and the monitor
was able to synchronize correctly.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497181"></a>Saturday, 3:11 am</h3></div></div></div><p>
O Entsetzen! These are nasty bugs...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497193"></a>Saturday, 5:43 am</h3></div></div></div><p>
It's too late now, I'm getting nowhere. Time to sleep.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497206"></a>Saturday, 1:32 pm</h3></div></div></div><p>
Let's see if those wretched bugs can evade me now that I'm fully awake!
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497218"></a>Saturday, 8:58 pm</h3></div></div></div><p>
Okay. Maybe I'm not going about this the right way. These chips probably
have bugs that aren't documented. I need more information. I should be
able to get driver sources from somewhere else. Let's try Linux and
Windows NT... Here they are! First Linux... hum, the source is 1 MB...
and a bit confusing. What are they doing ? Oh... it looks like they're
still using the old bank-switching mode. What about Windows NT? Oops! The
source is even bigger (1.3 MB) and it's even more confusing. Huge macros
everywhere... links to their global graphic system... and more source
code.
</p><p>
Linux, Windows NT... in both cases it looks like it will take days or
weeks to understand what they're doing and reproduce it. And they're not
even supporting some of the advanced features used by the Be drivers.
Probably the best is just to look for specific comments about the 968.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497238"></a>Saturday, 9:17 pm</h3></div></div></div><p>
I'm going nowhere again. Too big, too complex, too different. My driver
is probably almost working, except for a few bugs. Stupid to begin
everything again from scratch... Okay, let's try disassembling the
Windows driver.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497253"></a>Sunday, 6:02 am</h3></div></div></div><p>
Looks like another big failure. They're doing strange things in a strange
order. And the API is so complex! I hope I never have to write a driver
for that OS. Off to sleep. Maybe I'll have another idea tomorrow...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497267"></a>Sunday, 2:16 pm</h3></div></div></div><p>
I was doing things the wrong way. What I need to do is just put the card
on my Wintel machine in a mode that's as close as possible to the one
used on my BeBox and then dump the values of the registers. Then all I
have to do is check what my <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™ driver is doing. Pretty simple. I
should have done that in the beginning.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497287"></a>Sunday, 3:57 pm</h3></div></div></div><p>
Criminidly! I've set the registers to be as identical as possible, given
the differences in the settings between the machines. But it's still not
working! Svenami! There are probably bugs in the program order too! I
remember that there's a case in which you have to first set register A to
0 before you set register B to a specific value, and only *then* could
you set A to its real value... Dumping the registers won't help here.
</p><p>
But I have one more solution: Where's my logic analyzer?
</p><p>
[We told you the geek was resourceful.]
</p><p>
I'll plug the analyzer into my Wintel machine and spy on the transactions
between the CPU and the graphics card. I can only store one set of 1024
samples, and I need 2 samples per transaction. But 500 transactions
should be more than enough. Lets see what it's doing when it turns on the
graphics card in default mode during the boot...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497324"></a>Sunday, 4:04 pm</h3></div></div></div><p>
Uh oh, it looks like there are going to be more than 500 transactions.
Why so many? Strange. Bah, there are probably just a few more. Let's keep
tracking...
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497337"></a>Monday, 12:19 am</h3></div></div></div><p>
I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I've already looked at 40,000
transactions, and there are still more... Just to boot the card! What's
going on? Is there a devil in the board? What's it doing? Can a virus
have reprogrammed the BIOS ROM? My God! The guys who wrote these pazzo
drivers are completely crazy! Wait... I know one of them! Perhaps I can
get a few hints out of him. It's not too late to call...
</p><p>
"Hi John, it's Paul. How are you?... Me too, me too... No, I called
because I was just trying to adapt a driver for your 968-based graphics
card... Yes, that one... How long!?... It took two engineers an entire
year to get the Wintel driver working?!... I understand better now... A
lot of bugs? I can believe it... So thanks John, see you soon."
</p><p>
Perhaps I chose the wrong card. Better to try another one. Oh, here's my
Matrox Millenium. Where's the databook? How could I not have the databook?
</p><p>
[Remember, the geek always has everything he needs.]
</p><p>
Oh, I remember, I tried to get it two months ago, but John said even they
couldn't get it. Matrox just doesn't give it out. Pretty annoying...
Looks like I'll have to wait for Be or a third party to give me new
drivers. They said they're working on it...

Like many other Be developers, StarCode Software jumped at the chance to
develop for this new and exciting platform. The BeOS represents an
intriguing mix of old and new. The Be interface is a strange blend of
Windows, Macintosh, and even some UNIX interface ideas which seem to work
well together. The stability and performance of preemptive multitasking
and memory protection are a welcome change on the personal computer
frontier. The small, flexible Be API is much less intimidating than the
numerous "Inside Macintosh" volumes. The database and multimedia support
are full of tremendous potential.
</p><p>
As many people were quick to point out, Be was crazy to try to build
another OS when the world seems to embrace only a small handful of OSes.
What Be had going for them, whether they knew it or not, was an OS that
would appeal to a wide range of users, from geeks and hobbyists to
multimedia designers. And with the introduction of the PowerMac port, Be
has an opportunity to reach the mainstream.
</p><p>
Even though there's a lot of work left to be done on the OS and certain
aspects of development are still frustrating, we should start seeing a
change on the applications front over the next six months. Be is in a
perfect position to aggressively track down great products from other
platforms. Some areas where we see wonderful opportunities for small
shops are: A hybrid resource/database editor, some memory/heap tracking
tools, a news reader, and a graphical FTP client.
</p><p>
Located in Menlo Park, California, StarCode Software specializes in
writing software management tools for the Be platform. We will be
releasing the first version of our software installer, the Package
Builder, during the second half of September. This is a critical step for
developers to have a better tool than tar to distribute their software.
Preliminary versions of the Package Builder will be free while we close
in on a commercial quality product. (Feel free to suggest features and
report bugs.)
</p><p>
Following the Package Builder, we will begin developing a second product,
the Software Valet, which will help users spend less time managing their
software and more time using it. Early versions will keep track of a
user's installed applications (and concomitant software "packages"), thus
allowing the user to easily and cleanly uninstall particular programs
(for example). Later versions will track software compatibility, offer
software upgrade assistance, and automate registration.
</p><p>
We're excited to bring these tools to the Be platform. For more
information, send us e-mail at info@StarCode.com or check out our web
site at http://www.StarCode.com. By the way, we're looking for another
engineer. If you're interested, see the job announcement on our web site.

I well recall, in a reminiscence that will date me as a startup ancient,
my painful technolust for the portable Z80- based CP/M machine called the
Osborne 1. I saved up my L, s, and d in anticipation of purchasing my own
Osborne 1—until Adam Osborne, the company's eponymous founder,
announced the second-generation machine somewhat ahead of its shipment
date, with the unfortunate effect that sales of the first product ground
to a halt as everyone (myself included) waited for the newer, far
superior, Osborne 2. The company failed and bequeathed its legacy to the
computer industry:
</p><p>
Os-borne (Awz'born) vi. to cause a decrease in or elimination of sales of
a product by announcing its replacement prematurely.
</p><p>
Despite this, companies continue to announce—or leak—information
about new products before they are available. Sometimes this is simple
misadventure, but there are other motives for early announcement, some
pure, some not so pure.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A company wishing to wage war on competitors with superior products
may pre-announce its even more superior product to encourage customers
to wait and not buy from the competition. Sometimes the even more
superior product exists or is being developed. But not always.
</p></li><li><p>
Companies with suboptimal products (a computer industry term for
products that don't actually work very well, if at all) may announce a
long-term future product that, of course, fixes all the deficiencies of
the current one.
</p></li><li><p>
A company wishing to gauge reactions to a product idea may announce
the idea as an actual product in development. If enough orders arrive,
maybe they'll build the product. Sometimes they even succeed.
</p></li><li><p>
Some companies make the 16th century Tudor Courts seem calm, loyal,
and altruistic by comparison: A rancorous faction within a company may
make a premature announce- ment—and an implied commitment to
customers—simply to lock the company into a particular direction.
</p></li><li><p>
And, finally, some companies pre-announce products to keep their
customers informed about future directions.
</p></li></ul><p>
I'm prompted to write about Premature Announcement Syndrome because we
may have unintentionally been unclear about the nature of two recent
announcements: Our licensing of OpenGL® from Silicon Graphics and our
agreement with Metrowerks to develop Java tools for the BeOS. Our intent
was to inform about our future direction.
</p><p>
In both cases, our announcements met two important criteria: They were
news and they were factual. We had indeed concluded a license agreement
with Silicon Graphics and had indeed agreed with Metrowerks that they
would develop Java tools for the BeOS. Neither was a product
announcement, but both have been interpreted as such by some people. We
apologize for the confusion. Our intent was, and still is, to indicate
two important directions for the BeOS: That it will support the OpenGL®
API, making the porting and development of OpenGL®-based applications
much easier; and that we are planning to support Java, an important
emerging language.
</p><p>
We'll announce both products when they ship, with a target for both of
them late this year or early next year.

There are a number of reasons why I like Samuel Adams, or Boston Beer,
the brewery. It makes excellent beers and, for Be, an excellent metaphor
—a little outside my usual range perhaps, but an example of a well-run
company that succeeds in a market dominated by giants. Recent events have
rekindled my interest in the metaphor and also provided an answer to
observers who kindly teased me by pointing to a flaw in the imagery.
</p><p>
The first event is a very nice story written by Steve Kaufman, a staff
writer at the San Jose "Mercury News." The piece appeared September 9
and, thanks to the net, was brought to my attention by friends over in
France. Titled "Companies Putting the 'Public' Back into IPOs," the
column describes how companies such as Boston Beer or Starbuck Coffee
make sure small individual investors do not get shut out of "public"
offerings. Boston Beer allocated 20 percent of the 4.5-million-share
offering to customers who called for a prospectus and the opportunity to
buy shares at $15 each. What's remarkable isn't that shares still trade
above the IPO price (quote symbol SAM: $21 today), it's that Jim Koch,
Boston Beer's CEO, took the extra pain and money required to include
consumers in the IPO. It took an extra shot of pain in dealing with the
SEC, getting their approval, writing a special consumers-only prospectus,
and spending over a million dollars in the process. Apparently, this was
money wisely invested. The consumer/shareholders turned out to be Boston
Beer's best promoters, they got cards identifying them as Boston Beer
co-owners and everywhere they went, demanded to know why the store or the
restaurant they were in wasn't carrying Samuel Adams beer.
</p><p>
This isn't the way most companies do IPOs. In order to get stock in a hot
IPO, you need friends in high places. Either at the company or in one of
the firms handling the new issue. The little guy stands outside that cozy
network and only gets to buy after the insiders and their cronies made
their profits on the initial rise. Too bad if the stock falls back not
only from the early apex, but also below the offering price, as it did
often in recent hyped-up offerings.
</p><p>
This is not a new phenomenon. In 1980, I got a call from Aaron Orlhansky,
a financial analyst from a US brokerage house located in Paris. We used
to meet for lunch, he brought press releases and prospectuses, I
interpreted the technical jargon, and he picked up the tab. One day, by
way of thanking me for pointing Tandem to him, he offered to get me stock
in the upcoming IPO of Apple Computer. I declined, preferring to stick
with my small Tandem position. He also mentioned that Tom Lawrence, then
Apple's VP of European Operations, was looking for someone to start Apple
France. This time, I bit.
</p><p>
Back to Boston Beer, I used to like the company because it made an
excellent case for both contrarian wisdom and plain old good execution.
Back in the seventies, the Boston Consulting Group and their brethren
sold concepts such as "forward pricing" and "size is everything". As a
result, we witnessed ugly copulations of large corporate bodies,
megaconcentrations in the food, tobacco, and beverage businesses.
Anheuser Busch bought competitors, Philip Morris bought Miller breweries,
and we got corporate beer, beer designed by committee, indifferent beer.
Less taste, more filling. On the consumers' taste buds, this left room
for more interesting beers. Microbreweries, an old pioneer tradition,
started to rise, so to speak. We got mediocre beer, so-so beer, and great
beer. Boston Beer rose from nowhere, initially with little support from
the financial community, with no manufacturing plant. But their beer
consistently won taste contests. They contracted capacity from other
breweries, stayed in control of the taste, the quality, and the cost, and
initially marketed the hell out of their product at beer festivals and
other connoisseur venues. Samuel Adams and the other fine microbrews
became so successful the giants woke up irritated and confused. Their
response? Imitation. By carefully reading the label of one such ersatz,
you'll find it's made under a license from a French industrial brewery.
The same attention to a Plank Road label will reveal it comes from the
makers of Miller Lite.
</p><p>
I was introduced to Boston Beer by one of our founders, Steve Sakoman,
home brewer himself, who felt Samuel Adams was one of the few commercial
brews worthy of real beer makers and drinkers. So, after metabolizing a
few pints, I started metaphorizing. Boston Beer and Jim Koch became one
of the examples that inspired our work. That was long before they went
public. Not only did Boston Beer execute well against conventional
wisdom, but when the time came for a hot IPO, they also treated their
consumer/shareholders warmly and creatively. Reading Steve Kaufman's
column made me feel we had indeed picked a good model.
</p><p>
What about the flaw in the imagery, then? Astute observers remarked this
microbrewery metaphor bucking contrarian thought was well and good, but
all beers are compatible with the installed base of refrigerators and
bottle openers. Our beer needed not just taste buds tired of legacy
brews, but also different refrigerators and bottle openers. It just
occurred to me that with the PowerMac port of the BeOS we might have
found nice standard fridges and church keys.

AKA: Be Audio Stats<br />
AKA: AES/EBU
</h5></div></div></div><p>
More discussion of sound cards vs in-box audio. This week we had
comparisons with Gravis Ultrasound and Soundblaster AWE-32. In a
related thread, a call was made for AES/EBU connectors on the BeBox.
Also, there was some speculation on Be's GM synthesizer.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: We will be releasing the General MIDI synthesizer through
our Web site in a few weeks. Stay tuned.

AKA: Clicks, doubles n' drags<br />
AKA: Multiple Clicking<br />
(and so on)
</h5></div></div></div><p>
A number of mouse issues:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
When the user double-clicks the mouse, what messages should be
sent to the target application: Two single clicks? A single click
followed by a double-click? One double-click? Should the application
be able to specify which of these it wants?
</p></li><li><p>
Should a double-click always do something "constructive" (such as
open a document), or can it be destructive—can it be defined to
quit an application, for example?
</p></li><li><p>
What's a "click": Is it a mouse-down, or a mouse- down/mouse-up?
</p></li><li><p>
How should a three-button mouse be emulated by a mouse with only
two buttons? Should the user be allowed to choose the form of
emulation?
</p></li><li><p>
When a dragged item is dropped, how should the source (window) be
informed of the item's new location?
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497816"></a>Subject: RunFilePanel and RunSavePanel</h4></div></div></div><p>
It was suggested that the open and save panels allow broader file
filtering and format conversion. Currently, the BApplication class lets
you filter files based on their types (only).
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497830"></a>Subject: Floating point performance</h4></div></div></div><p>
The clarion has sounded: Use floating point. It's fast, it's easy, and
it's (sometimes) free. Not much controversy here—but some cautions:
Division is slow, as is int&lt;=&gt;fp conversion. Pierre Raynaud-Richard
offered a handy rundown on the comparative speeds of various operations
in various contexts.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id497847"></a>Subject: Bug Errata for BeOS would be wonderful.</h4></div></div></div><p>
Many developers wrote in to cast their vote for publicly disclosed bug
reports (from Be). Many of these developers have been asking for this
sort of support for quite awhile. Speculation is that Be doesn't have
the necessary technology...
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: The hang-up hasn't been technology as much as manpower
stretched thin. But you're right—you deserve to see bug reports and
we will give them to you soon (honest). Look for an announcement within
a couple of weeks.
