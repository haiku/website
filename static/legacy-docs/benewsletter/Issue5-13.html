As many of you may have noticed, there is no hardware acceleration for
OpenGL in BeOS 5. One reason for this is that we were in the middle of a
major re-write of OpenGL which would not support hardware acceleration of
BGLView. Another reason is that there were a number of bugs in the
previous drivers that prevented other parts of the Be API from
functioning normally. As a result, we didn't ship a new version of
experimental drivers with BeOS 5, knowing that we would be able to
provide much better drivers based on the new implementation shortly after
BeOS 5 shipped.
</p><p>
The latest changes dramatically improve both performance and stability
with hardware acceleration. The triangle throughput and texture upload
speeds have been greatly enhanced and multitexture support has been
added. Device enumeration now allows the application to properly
determine if it is using a full screen device, eliminating the annoying
problem of apps taking over the entire screen.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id521123"></a>What's New in the Rewrite?</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
The geometry pipeline has been rewritten to take full advantage of
SIMD processors. This results in large performance improvements on
SIMD enabled CPUs such as the PIII. We also improved the scalar
pipeline that enhances performance on the Celeron and PII line.
</p></li><li><p>
There's a new OS-specific interface layer for OpenGL. Previously, a
number of issues limited our ability to provide proper (i.e., good)
hardware support within the constraints of the existing <code class="classname">BGLView</code> API.
To fix these and add a number of new features we created a new API.
<code class="classname">BDirectGLWindow</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
Multiple monitors and hardware devices are supported. It's now
possible to render to multiple monitors and hardware cards using
OpenGL. Monitors other than your primary display are treated as full
screen-only devices.
</p></li><li><p>
There's a new locking model. A limitation of <code class="classname">BGLView</code> was that each
application had a global GL lock that only allowed one thread to
render at a given time, even if the rendering was to multiple windows.
This limitation has been lifted, allowing apps to better leverage
multiple CPUs.
</p></li><li><p>
The primary display gets proper full screen support. This allows
applications to resize the display and change color depth and still be
cleaned up safely should they crash. Previously, applications needed
to use the <code class="classname">BScreen</code> API that was not safe.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id521194"></a>Locking</h3></div></div></div><p>
One of the biggest changes between the old and new versions is the
introduction of a completely new locking model for OpenGL. The purpose of
locking in OpenGL is to associate a context with a window. This is
necessary because OpenGL is a C-based API with no explicit connection
between a function and the rendering context (Window). The old mechanism
handled this by requiring an application to grab a global lock for a
window. Once the lock was acquired, all calls to the C API would go to
the locked window. The major problem with this is that when you have
multiple CPUs and Windows, since the lock is global, you effectively
force single threading across windows.
</p><p>
The new locking mechanism now locks the drawing to a window to a specific
thread. This is done through three functions in <code class="classname">BDirectGLWindow</code>:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="methodname">MakeCurrent()</code> Makes the current thread the drawing thread for the
window. If another thread is already current for the window this
function will block until the previous owner releases it.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="methodname">ReleaseCurrent()</code> Release the current thread. This allows other
threads to grab the context.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="methodname">YieldCurrent()</code> Release and reacquire the context. This is exactly the
same as calling <code class="methodname">ReleaseCurrent()</code> followed
by <code class="methodname">MakeCurrent()</code>. The purpose
is to provide a very low cost method to allow others to grab the
context if necessary. If no other process is blocked on the context,
this will just return without the release/acquire overhead.
</p></li></ul><p>
Holding a lock for too long blocks other OS functionality, as this lock
will block a <code class="methodname">DirectConnected</code> call and some other internal OpenGL
functionality. As a result, an application should release the context
before beginning any long non-drawing functions and should call Yield
within your rendering loop.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id521272"></a>Device Enumeration</h3></div></div></div><p>
The second major new feature is device enumeration and multidevice
support. Devices are divided into two categories. Primary devices are
those managed by the App server. Rendering in a window is supported on
these devices. Secondary devices are full screen-only devices. The
functions that follow support this mechanism:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span> EnumerateDevices(
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">monitor_id</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">color</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">depth</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">stencil</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">accum</code>)
</pre><p>
This function provides a list of devices that meet the requirements
specified. The value of <code class="parameter">monitor_id</code> is <code class="constant">BGL_MONITOR_PRIMARY</code>, to return
devices that can render to the standard desktop. <code class="constant">BGL_MONITOR_OTHER</code>
returns a list of non-desktop monitors. You can also specify a specific
monitor. The other parameters will specify the application's minimum
requirements for buffer depths. The most common parameters to use will be
<code class="constant">BGL_NONE</code>, <code class="constant">BGL_ANY</code>,
<code class="constant">BGL_FASTEST</code>, <code class="constant">BGL_HIGH_QUALITY</code>. You can specify a
specific buffer depth, but in most cases you'll want to use one of the
above.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
virtual <span class="type">void</span> DeviceInfo(
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">device_id</code>,
        <span class="type">unit32</span> <code class="parameter">monitor_id</code>,
        <span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">name</code>,
        <span class="type">bool</span> <code class="parameter">depth</code>,
        <span class="type">bool</span> <code class="parameter">stencil</code>,
        <span class="type">bool</span> <code class="parameter">accum</code>)
</pre><p>
A call to <code class="function">EnumerateDevices</code> generates one or more calls to this function
to describe the devices. The application should record the <span class="type">device_id</span> for
devices the application may wish to use. The name will contain a human
readable description of the device. The three booleans indicate whether
the device can support some form of buffer of the specified type.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
virtual <span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">videoModeInfo</code>(
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">mode_id</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">width</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">height</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">color</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">depth</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">stencil</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">accum</code> )
</pre><p>
For each call to <code class="function">DeviceInfo</code>, one or more calls to
<code class="function">VideoModeInfo</code> will
follow to describe the abilities of the device. If <code class="parameter">width</code> is zero the
device is a windowed device. <code class="parameter">width</code> and <code class="parameter">height</code> that contain a non-zero
value describe a full screen mode. The <code class="parameter">color</code>,
<code class="parameter">depth</code>, <code class="parameter">stencil</code>, and <code class="parameter">accum</code>
parameters will contain the specific depths of each buffer.
</p><p>
Using the information obtained from the above calls you can initialize
the OpenGL window and context by calling <code class="methodname">InitializeGL</code>.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="function">InitializeGL</code>(
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">device_id</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">color</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">depth</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">stencil</code>,
        <span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">accum</code> )
</pre><p>
The <code class="parameter">device_id</code> is one of the ids returned in
one of the <code class="function">DeviceInfo</code> calls.
The other buffer information can be any of the four standard defines
(none, any, fastest, high_quality) or the info from <code class="function">VideoModeInfo</code>. After
the call to <code class="function">InitializeGL</code>, you are free to call
<code class="methodname">MakeCurrent</code> and begin
rendering.
</p><p>
<code class="methodname">ShutdownGL()</code>
</p><p>
Destroys the OpenGL context and releases any resources it was using.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id433521"></a>Window Maintenance Routines</h3></div></div></div><p>
By default, the OpenGL rendering area consumes the entire window. It's
illegal to draw into the area of a window owned by OpenGL using any means
other than the GL API. The results of doing so are not defined. The same
applies to reading pixels back from the window. The routines described
below are provided to reserve a portion of the window for other drawing.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
virtual <code class="classname">BRect</code> UpdateGLRect( <code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">window_rect</code> )
</pre><p>
This function should be overloaded if the application desires to restrict
drawing to a portion of the window. It must be <code class="methodname">DirectConnected</code> safe,
meaning that it cannot call normal App server routines. The full window
rect is passed in as <code class="parameter">window_rect</code> and the function should return the area
that OpenGL will use for its drawing.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">SetGLRect</code>()
</pre><p>
Trigger a call to <code class="methodname">UpdateGLRect</code> to set the GL drawing area.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span> SetFullScreen( <span class="type">bool</span> <code class="varname">full_screen</code>)
</pre><p>
Toggles the window between full screen and windowed modes. Setting a
window to full screen changes the video mode to the nearest supported
full screen resolution to the current window size. Therefore, to set the
video mode to 800x600 you would set the window size to 800x600 and the
call <code class="code"><code class="methodname">SetFullScreen</code>( <code class="constant">true</code> )</code>
to change the video mode.
</p><p>
Note: This function actually resides in <code class="classname">DirectWindow</code>, but the
functionality changes slightly when a GL context is active.

Not long ago, Dominic wrote an article about the kernel debugger
<a class="xref" href="Issue4-30.html#Engineering4-30" title="Be Engineering Insights: Welcome to Kernel Debugging Land">Be Engineering Insights: Welcome to Kernel Debugging Land</a>
</p><p>
It's about time to talk about such things again.
</p><p>
BeOS 5 brings a number of changes to kernel debugging. Some of them are
quite visible, others are a little more subtle. Let's take a look at
what's new:
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id433691"></a>Invoking the Kernel Debugger</h3></div></div></div><p>
We've seen a number of bug reports along the lines of "ALT-PrintScreen"
freezes BeOS. What's actually happened is that you've entered the kernel
debugger. And if you didn't have some type of serial terminal connected
to your first serial port (at 19200 bps, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop
bit, aka 19200N81), you might have been confused by the lack of response.
We've listened! Starting with BeOS 5, you'll need to hold down
ALT-PrintScreen and then tap the "d" key. This should prevent people who
are trying to save a screenshot from being accidentally teleported to the
strange and wonderful habitat of the kernel debugger.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id433702"></a>On-Console Debugging</h3></div></div></div><p>
Of course, sometimes bad things happen and the kernel crashes.
Previously, this would look as if the machine had just stopped. In BeOS
5, the app_server is kind enough to let the kernel know where screen
memory lives, so the kernel debugger can display information on-screen
when something goes wrong.
</p><p>
By default, if you invoke the debugger or the system crashes, you'll see
your screen partially overwritten with a friendly message from the kernel
debugger that includes processor registers, a stack crawl, some
information about what team and thread were running, etc. Right now this
only happens on x86. If you're a frequent user of the kernel debugger you
may prefer the serial debug version. If you have a line in
<code class="filename">/boot/home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/kernel</code> that looks like
</p><pre class="screen">
bluescreen false
</pre><p>
you won't get the on-screen debugger. The display is actually black text
on a white background, even though the option is called "bluescreen".
</p><p>
If you're in the on-screen debugger, input is accepted from the PS2 or AT
keyboard. The USB stack is far, far too complex to operate inside the
kernel debugger. You can type "set serial" at the prompt to cause input
to be taken from the serial port instead.
</p><p>
If things are scrolling off-screen (e.g., the <span class="application">ps</span> command), you may want
to do something like <code class="command">set paginate on</code> and <code class="command">set pagesize 40</code>.
</p><p>
In the event of a crash or debugger request, you'll see some information
dumped immediately. The following is an example:
</p><pre class="screen">

The kernel debugger provides many commands by default (type <code class="command">help</code> at the
prompt to see a pretty extensive list). This code and related data takes
up memory that is locked and not paged. In low-memory conditions (perhaps
on some form of appliance...) you might want to avoid using memory for
debugging code in the final shipping environment. Now it's as easy as
removing the modules you don't want.
</p><p>
<code class="filename">/system/add-ons/kernel/debugger</code> contains several modules:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>disasm (26k)</td><td>the disassembler (provides "dis" command, etc)</td></tr><tr><td>gdb-stub (7k)</td><td>allows for remote GDB debugging (experimental)</td></tr><tr><td>i586 (5k)</td><td>some x86 specific extensions (machine
specific regs, fp regs, single step,
and runto support)</td></tr><tr><td>internals (48k)</td><td>debugging commands for fsil, devfs,
threads, modules, ports, elfloader,
cache and vm</td></tr><tr><td>parser (7k)</td><td>allows expressions to be entered in
the debugger</td></tr><tr><td>symbols (5k + 200k)</td><td>loads the kernel symbols and allows
<code class="function">load_driver_symbols()</code> to work, ads
"lkup"</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
If you want to write your own debugger module (to add some neat new
functionality not previously available), it's pretty easy:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
#include &lt;OS.h&gt;
#include &lt;module.h&gt;

That's no doubt what many of our would be downloaders will say when they
hear about our last minute misadventure. At 4:45 a.m. PST, we lost our
Net connection. On the very morning of the release of BeOS 5, users and
mirror sites could not get what we promised to deliver this Tuesday,
March 28th—access to the free, Personal Edition. The cyber highway
isn't the only one that's congested today. Outside our office, El Camino
has a familiar Parisian look—traffic is jammed, two drivers just bent
some metal, lanes are closed, and people with hard hats and orange vests
are milling around an open trench. The rumor is that the proverbial
backhoe has struck again. We're sorry to cause frustration and we
apologize for the untimely broken connection.
</p><p>
Other than that, it's a great day. We finally released BeOS 5, with many
improvements, including an MP3 _encoder, new MIDI kit with microsecond
resolution timing, support for 1394, isochronous USB, more drivers, a
lower-memory footprint, new file systems support (such as read-only NTFS
and CDDA), support for multiple networking cards, Lucent and PC-Tel
softmodem, Pentium III optimization... The list is long and available at
&lt;http://www.be.com/products/freebeos/beosspecs.html&gt;. Just as important
as the free download, we now offer a "partition-free" install. This
appears as a large file on your Windows system; when you launch BeOS, the
host shuts down and BeOS runs by itself.
</p><p>
A caveat: as a sage here once announced on a sign above his cube, I'm
moving to Theory because everything works in Theory. In other words, your
experience may vary. The interaction between Windows and the hardware it
runs on is nothing if not idiosyncratic. The shutdown process could leave
your machine in an unknown state, which means that BeOS may or may not
find a state it can reset to the values it needs. The situation is
similar on dual-processor systems: Windows 98 automagically disables the
second processor on some systems and leaves it in that state when
shutting down.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there is an easy remedy: Please make a BeOS boot floppy.
This is not an academic recommendation. If BeOS supports your hardware
configuration but doesn't boot from Windows, it will boot unencumbered
from your BeOS boot floppy.

As the media have already noted, we're also releasing the source code for
the Tracker and the Deskbar, with a license that's a little more liberal
than most. This allows interested programmers to modify the appearance
and behavior of their systems and to gain better insights into the
philosophy behind BeOS. Here again, we want to be cautious. We don't want
to represent that we're open sourcing BeOS, nor are we implying anything
about the future. This said, I'm personally curious to see what the most
creative Be developers will do with the source code we're freeing today.

So far, in spite of our connection problems, thanks to one site in
Germany, &lt;http://www.computerchannel.de/specials/beos/&gt;, we already had
more than 25,000 downloads by mid-morning PST. This is much appreciated
and, as I write this, we're doing our best to clear the clogged arteries.
