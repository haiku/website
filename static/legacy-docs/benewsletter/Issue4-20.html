Writing a network file system for the BeOS is an interesting challenge.
Our network stack is in user space, and file systems are handled in
kernel space. This will change in the as-yet uncode-named Release 5, when
the network stack will go into the kernel. But until then, you must
straddle this fence between kernel and user space. How do you do this?
Since you'll have code in both places, you'll need a way to communicate
between them. One way to do this is with ports, which I'll use as an
illustration. With your code separated, you must pay special attention to
various types of failures and be able to handle them.
</p><p>
I've written a trivial network file system to show how to make network
calls from the kernel (or anywhere, as you'll see). This file system, the
"one file network file system" (OFNFS), consists of one file. The OFNFS
listens to a specified UDP port for broadcasts, and changes its name and
modification time. OFNFS is just simple enough for me to write quickly
(and get back to writing CIFS—more later), and just complex enough to
show the extra worries that network file systems bring. Oh, and I'd also
like to say that the communication package OFNFS uses is from one of our
Be developers, Andreas Huber. Andreas has just made his NFS source code
available on Beware, so grab that as well if you're into networked file
systems.
</p><p>
So, download the source code from
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/add-ons/ofnfs.tgz&gt;, and follow along --
I've tried to make copious comments in all the right places. Notice that
the file system consists of two programs: the file system add-on and the
user-level stub that makes socket calls. The user level stub is called
ksocketd, and it must be running for the file system to communicate with
the network. A named port is used to transfer data between the add-on and
ksocketd. The add-on makes calls like 'ksocket' and 'krecvfrom', which
behave functionally identically to 'socket' and 'recvfrom'. We use the
'param' parameter with the mount system call to pass in the port to use.
We start up our network connection, and then spawn a kernel thread that
will listen for packets on our UDP port. When we get a packet, we rename
our file to whatever string we find in the packet. When we're told to
unmount, we signal our listening thread to die, and then exit.
</p><p>
Simple, eh? Ah grasshopper, but what do you do when things go wrong? The
number one priority of a net fs developer should be handling error
conditions. So—what could go wrong? Well, in the case of OFNFS, a
great deal. Surprised? Let me count the ways: What happens if you get a
packet that contains '\\\\\\'? This is definitely not a legal file name.
What happens if the net server (our blessed network stack) gets
restarted? You'd need to recreate your socket, and rebind to it. Hmm --
what happens if it crashes? You'll have to be prepared for your socket
calls to start returning error messages. And what if ksocketd gets
killed? In that case, you're effectively cut off from communicating with
the network. No problem for OFNFS, you just don't get name changes
anymore. But what if you're a not-so trivial file system, like... CIFS!
</p><p>
Allow me tell you about the current work on CIFS. In case you don't know,
CIFS stands for "Common Internet File System." It's the fancy name for
the protocol that Microsoft products use to share files, locate network
resources, and other things. You may also know that a software package
called Samba allows Unix machines to communicate with Microsoft boxes.
(The name "Samba" comes from the fact that the protocol has traditionally
been known as SMB, or "Server Message Block.") There will be a CIFS
add-on in the experimental folder of Genki, which will let you use files
from Microsoft or Samba-enhanced Unix machines. Use and abuse.
</p><p>
Getting back to the point, how do you handle errors in a "real" network
file system? In short, "as gracefully as possible." Let's start with a
specific example. Say your NT box dies a horrible, bluishly tinted death
while you're in the middle of transferring a file. First off, how do you
know when the server has crashed? You'll to need to set some timeouts on
all your network transactions, so that you'll notice when your file
server isn't responding. Meanwhile, you can start passing out errors as
if they were fruitcakes. The user-level application should close all file
descriptors to you, allowing the user to unmount your now worthless file
system. Maybe you're optimistic; you'll think about reconnecting to the
server. You'll have to log in again, so you need to whatever
authentication info you were given at mount time. You also need to think
about a reconnect policy—do you want to try to reconnect every time
you think there's a serious error? Since reconnections have large
latencies, this could prove extremely aggravating to the user. Think
about limiting your number of retries, or limiting the number of retries
you'll make in some limited time frame. (That is, you can retry three
times in a 10-second period, then wait ten seconds. Insert your heuristic
here.)
</p><p>
In conclusion, here are some tips on network file systems:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Since you'll probably cache some kind of information on the server,
keep an eye on your memory usage. The kernel exports some useful
memory calls: <code class="function">smalloc</code>, <code class="function">sfree</code>,
<code class="function">scalloc</code>, etc. The extra "s" here is for
"swappable"; normally, memory allocated in the kernel is locked down
and never paged out. Memory returned by these calls can be swapped out.
</p></li><li><p>
The kernel debugger is your friend. If you write a network file
system (or any file system for that matter), you'll develop a very
intimate relationship with it. For info on the kernel debugger, please
read "<a class="xref" href="Issue3-21.html#Engineering3-21" title="Be Engineering Insights: Windows 95 Experience on BeOS—Or How to Hack on BeOS">Be Engineering Insights: Windows 95 Experience on BeOS—Or How to Hack
on BeOS</a>", by Victor Tsou.
</p></li><li><p>
Be careful reading in packets. Perform sanity checks on data you
receive. (Example: I had a bug in
<acronym class="acronym">CIFS</acronym>,
caused by reading data from
the wrong place in a packet, that led to attempts to malloc huge
pieces of memory. It is unwise to blindly malloc 2GB.)
</p></li><li><p>
Be militantly paranoid about reading strings. Do not use any of the
normal string functions; always use the number-limited versions (i.e.,
<code class="function">strncpy</code>, <code class="function">strncat</code>...). If you walk past the end of your string, you
will crash the kernel. <code class="constant">B_DONT_DO_THAT</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
Be prepared for everything to die. ksocketd could die. The net
server could restart, or it could just up and quit. If you end up
waiting for a response from the network without having some kind of
timeout, you will block forever in the kernel. This is a
<span class="trademark">Bad Thing</span>™. Your file server could die, and never get back to you. Or,
it could die, and come back on-line, and start claiming it doesn't
know you. You'll have to reauthenticate to it. Your cache information
is probably stale now.
</p></li><li><p>
Think ahead about what kind of failure policy you want to enforce;
a little bit of design here goes a long way.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Since this is my first newsletter article, I'd appreciate it if you'd
drop me a line telling me if it was at all helpful to you. Thinking about
writing a network file system? Let me know. (Please understand that time
is a precious commodity between now and golden master day, though.)

One of the questions most asked often of
<acronym class="acronym" title="Developer Technical Support">DTS</acronym> lately is, "How do I make my
<span class="trademark">OpenGL</span>™ app use hardware acceleration?"—or some variation thereof. OK,
here's how. If you're running Genki 5 or 6, with your trusty Voodoo2 card
installed, along with the glide2 package from the optional folder of the
Genki CD, you're ready to get started.
</p><p>
I have a pair of simple examples here, which allow you to test your setup
and which show you the basics of hardware acceleration. To do this, I've
taken the GLTeapot example code straight off the Release 4 CD and made
minimal changes, accelerating from ~40 fps to ~200 fps. That's cool.
You'll find the code at &lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/open
gl/GLTeapot-Voodoo.zip&gt;. All changes are labeled "voodoo" for easy
viewing.
</p><p>
The two big alterations to GLTeapot are adding full screen mode for
hardware acceleration and changing the resize mode of our view from
<code class="constant">B_FOLLOW_ALL</code> to <code class="constant">B_FOLLOW_NONE</code>.
This is so that our view resizes to the size
of the window. With Voodoo hardware, we must be in 800x600 or less to get
hardware acceleration. You'll see that most of the code changes simply
involve my adding the fancy
<span class="keysym">Alt</span>+<span class="keycap">F</span> switch and menu option to go from
window mode to full screen mode and back.
</p><p>
Another quick example is converting Michael Morrissey's 3DLife
<a class="xref" href="Issue3-34.html#DevWorkshop3-34" title="Developers Workshop: Life in Three Dimensions">Developers Workshop: Life in Three Dimensions</a> to make
use of Voodoo hardware. The code for this is at
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/open_gl/3Dlife-Voodoo.zip&gt;. The changes
here are a bit more extensive, but they're still relatively minor. In
lifeView.cpp, we again change the resize mode of our view to
<code class="constant">B_FOLLOW_NONE</code>. In <code class="filename">lifeWin.cpp</code> we change our main window
to a <code class="classname">BDirectWindow</code>, and
enable DirectMode with <code class="code"><code class="varname">mv</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">EnableDirectMode</code>(<code class="constant">true</code></code>).
Also in <code class="filename">lifeWin.cpp</code> we
implement <code class="methodname">lifeWin::DirectConnected()</code> and pass them along to our view's
implementation of <code class="methodname">DirectConnected()</code>.
</p><p>
The only other changes are adding the menu option and hot switch to
switch between full screen and window mode.
</p><p>
This has been a short article, but I hope it answers one of DTS's most
frequently asked questions.

A quick look at my calendar tells me that PC Expo opens in less than five
weeks. I love trade shows—they're tiring, expensive, and, at times,
bewildering. But how else can we get to see so many customers,
developers, business partners, members of the commentariat, and
competitors large and nimble in so little time? Combine all that with New
York City and its robust culture, and you realize how unreal life can be
in Silicon Valley.
</p><p>
For us, though, the main point of PC Expo will be to show how the BeOS
incarnates the MediaOS concept. The classical trade show booth usually
revolves around one larger-than-life demo, plus some smaller stations for
showing particular products or aspects of what the company offers to
individuals and smaller groups. For this PC Expo we have more and more
spectacular demos of new applications from noted and soon-to-be-notable
developers, along with some new twists (perhaps literally) on our own
apps.
</p><p>
I still remember what an executive of a respected microprocessor company
said when seeing a BeOS demo for the first time: I didn't know my PC
could do that. That's one of the messages we want to broadcast as loud
and on as large a screen as show regulations and our budget will permit
-- within the limits of good taste, of course. As our departed Sales and
Marketing VP Alex Osadzinski used to say: No objectified humans and no
race cars. I quote him with both license and prudence.
</p><p>
Moving to the rest of the booth, we want to broadcast another message:
Here is what you can do. From one station to another you'll be able to
use applications to actually create, edit, produce, post-produce, merge,
fold, staple, and mutilate digital media. We hope that at the end of the
tour you'll go home with a sample of your work using tools made by BeOS
developers. Work and fun rolled into one. Speaking of the latter, we'll
also have the latest games available on the BeOS.
</p><p>
So, please come along. If you're a developer, we'd love to hear from you
and see how we can show off your work. If you're already a BeOS user,
please join us in celebrating what's happened since we first demonstrated
the x86 version of the BeOS. And if you're not a BeOS user yet, let us
give you some good reasons to make room on your hard disk for the Media
OS.
</p><p>
Watch our web site for details and/or e-mail us. We look forward to
seeing you in NYC.
