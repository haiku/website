to Solve a Problem</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Mani</span> <span class="surname">Varadarajan</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Anyone who has used the Time preference panel on the BeOS has seen that,
as of the Preview Release, the system understands the notion of a time
zone. In our increasingly technologically interconnected world, time zone
support is indispensable for allowing applications to have a uniform and
translatable sense of time between the various parts of the world. The
most common and obvious need for this are in e-mail and news messages,
which can originate anywhere in the world, and need to be sorted and
ordered correctly based on a uniform notion of time.
</p><p>
The time zone problem is not a trivial one to solve completely. For
example, in the American state of Indiana, where the county seats of
authority seem to be more independent minded than others, several
counties break with the rest of the state and have different policies
concerning Daylight Saving Time (where the clock is moved ahead an hour
for a portion of the year to utilize daylight). Such vagaries abound in
various other parts of the world.
</p><p>
Luckily, the BeOS is not the first system to face this problem. As all
good engineers eventually learn, one of the best ways of approaching an
old and theoretically uninteresting problem is to adapt someone else's
solution to one's needs. In this respect, because of its long history of
widespread usage, I found that the Unix world solved the problem most
completely and accurately. And since the world is also fortunate to have
access to the full source code base of multiple free, Unix-like operating
systems, I was easily able to adapt the code to the BeOS.
</p><p>
The BeOS implementation of time zone support is based on code from the
FreeBSD system (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.freebsd.org">http://www.freebsd.org</a>). This implementation has three
parts to it:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
a set of time zone "rules" files, in ASCII text
</p></li><li><p>
a "rules" compiler that translates these rules files to binary format
("zic", or the zone information compiler)
</p></li><li><p>
a set of C routines that understand these binary files
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Time zone rules files for virtually all parts of the world have been
compiled by various people on the Net. The latest versions of these
files, as well as source code for the rules compiler, is available at
ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/~ftp/pub.
</p><p>
The format of these files is trivial. For a given range of years (the
rules files are incredibly thorough, going back in some cases to the
1800s), there is a rule describing when Daylight Saving Time starts for
that zone. Finally, there is a line describing the offset from GMT for
this time zone. For Chicago, for example:
</p><pre class="screen">
Rule Chicago 1955  1966  -    Oct   lastSun 2:00  0    S
Zone North_and_Central_America/Chicago   -6:00  US  C%sT
</pre><p>
are the relevant lines.
</p><p>
The "Zic" compiles the rules files into binary format, one for each zone,
making the BeOS time zone setting just a reference to one of these files.
No magic here. [FYI: These files reside in /boot/beos/etc/timezones.] At
startup, the Bootscript runs a clock configuration program which checks
to see if the user has a time zone set.
</p><p>
The setting is the config/timezone file in the user's home directory, and
is normally a symbolic link to a file in the timezones/ hierarchy. If a
time zone is set, the system clock is conditionally warped to report GMT.
This is necessary on dual-boot systems such as the Mac where the Mac OS
stores local time and not GMT in the system clock.
</p><p>
The routines adapted from FreeBSD check to see if a time zone is set,
load the data files and adjust the time reported accordingly. If a
programmer wishes to privately change an application's notion of the time
zone without affecting the system's setting, she can do this in two ways:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Dynamically, from a shell
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
type "export TZ=&lt;timezone_setting&gt;"
</p></li><li><p>
launch the application from the shell
</p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>
From within the program, add this code:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">putenv</code>("TZ=&lt;timezone_setting&gt;");
<code class="function">tzset</code>();
</pre></li></ol></div><p>
Of course, replace &lt;timezone_setting&gt; with either the complete path name
of a time zone data file, or a path relative to the timezones/ directory.
In other words, both /boot/beos/etc/timezones/Greenland/Godthab and
Greenland/Godthab will work.
</p><p>
Just a simple example of stealing and adapting code to one's needs. May
the thievery flourish!

Designing a good user interface is not always easy; I know I've screwed
up enough of them in my time. But something which is sometimes equally
difficult is implementing a breathtaking user interface cleanly and
efficiently. While the BeOS's Kits allow relatively easy construction of
user interfaces, making them efficient (i.e., fast) is not as trivial.
I'd like to share some useful tips gleaned from the Be
graphics/app_server gurus, as well as from my own experiences writing
BeOS user interface code.
</p><p>
Tip #1: Avoid synchronous calls
</p><p>
There are two kinds of app_server calls: asynchronous and synchronous. An
asynchronous call sends off it's message to the app_server and returns to
the caller; in this way the server can process the client's request while
the client prepares more data to be sent. On a multiprocessor machine,
the client and server threads will be scheduled in parallel. This is
Good. Most app_server calls, including all calls that do drawing, are
asynchronous.
</p><p>
Synchronous calls are calls that require a response, for instance, those
that request input, like <code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">GetMouse()</code>,
or those that query for
server-side information, like <code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">StringWidth()</code>
or <code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">Bounds()</code>.
Synchronous calls are much slower than asynchronous calls, for several
reasons. First, the Interface Kit caches asynchronous calls and sends
them in large chunks at a time. A synchronous call requires that this
cache be flushed.
</p><p>
Secondly, the nature of a synchronous call requires that the client wait
for data from the server before returning, so not only must the server
send data back to the client, effectively doubling the latency of the
call, but the whole pathway is effectively serialized, as the client
blocks in the kernel waiting for the returned data. Synchronous calls are
Bad.
</p><p>
In general, caching data on the client side is a good way of avoiding
synchronous calls. Applications that do heavy-duty fast text layout, for
instance, should cache character escapements and compute string lengths
locally rather than calling StringWidth all the time, as Hiroshi
described in Newsletter 82.
</p><p>
Tip #2: Avoid asynchronous calls
</p><p>
"Huh?", I hear you cry, "First you say synchronous calls are Bad, and now
Asynchronous too? Aren't I allowed to call anything?"
</p><p>
Sure, but there are plenty of ways to reduce even the number of
asynchronous app_server transactions with a little more intelligence on
the client side. Some examples:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Given that you have many primitives to draw, try to order your
drawing such that all those with the same color and pen type are drawn
one after another. This avoids color and pen switching between
interface elements.
</p></li><li><p>
Exactly the same with fonts: draw all the text in a single font at
the same time, then switch fonts. For machines with small font caches,
this may also prevent font cache misses.
</p></li><li><p>
On the topic of clipping regions: always be aware of them, and don't
bother drawing things which are completely outside of it. Costly
app_server transactions must still be done even for completely clipped
primitives, since clipping is handled by the server.
</p></li><li><p>
Regularly use "batch" primitives like line arrays and
<code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">GetStringWidths()</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
Get used to using <code class="classname">BPicture</code>s; since they are stored on the server
side, they are a nice way of packaging up many primitives for very fast
drawing later. Once a <code class="classname">BPicture</code> is created and packed with any arbitrary
number of primitives, only a single app_server transaction is needed to
blast it to the screen.
</p></li><li><p>
Experiment with drawing directly. If interaction with one view
affects another view's appearance, it might be a good idea to update
that view directly by calling <code class="classname">BWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">UpdateIfNeeded()</code> after
invalidating it, or even by calling its <code class="methodname">Draw()</code> method yourself (or some
other more specific internal drawing method) to prevent waiting for the
round trip by the app_server update mechanism. You'll avoid the latency
and the update will look snappier.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="methodname">ConstrainClippingRegion()</code> can be used to improve speed and reduce
flicker by batching rectangle fill operations. Simply create a <code class="classname">BRegion</code>
consisting of all the rectangles you need filled, then pass it to
<code class="methodname">ConstrainClippingRegion()</code> and do a
<code class="methodname">FillRect()</code> on that <code class="classname">BRegion</code>'s
<code class="methodname">Frame()</code>. Only one app_server transaction is done, but you can fill an
arbitrary number of rectangles. (Keep in mind, however, that it can be
computationally expensive to create complex regions.)
</p></li></ul><p>
Tip #3: Don't abuse offscreen bitmaps
</p><p>
Each offscreen bitmap which views can draw into (a capability which is
specified at <code class="classname">BBitmap</code> creation time) has a server thread associated with
it to do its drawing. It's therefore wasteful to have lots of them lying
around. Try to share offscreen bitmaps between various views that need
them, or, at the very least, don't give every button its own offscreen
bitmap.
</p><p>
Remember that you don't always need an offscreen bitmap to avoid flicker,
and sometimes it is slower to use one than not. Line drawing and
rectangle filling, among other common operations, are accelerated by most
video cards; filling a rectangle or drawing a line to a bitmap can be
significantly slower than doing so directly to the screen.
</p><p>
Screen-to-screen blitting (using <code class="classname">BView</code>::<code class="methodname">CopyBits()</code>) is also commonly
accelerated, and will always be much faster than drawing the region to a
bitmap and blitting from main memory, which has to go over the PCI bus.
</p><p>
Don't be afraid to manipulate the bitmap data directly for critical path
speed-ups. Drawing a pixel or small rectangle directly into an offscreen
bitmap will be literally orders of magnitude faster than making an
app_server call to do the same thing, and it's pretty simple.
</p><p>
Tip #4: Don't unnecessarily occupy the window thread
</p><p>
The idea behind the window thread is that there will always be a thread
ready to react to a message from another window, or user input, or an
app_server update message. To allow this, try to keep the window thread
free. If you have a lot of processing or I/O to do, spawn another thread
to do it. If you need to track the mouse cursor over long periods of time
for interaction with a control, use asynchronous updates (by intercepting
MouseMoved messages) or, again, use another thread, if appropriate.
</p><p>
Keeping a window locked or its thread occupied for long periods of time
(i.e. over half a second or so) is Not Good. If a window thread becomes
unresponsive, and the user continues to provide input (even if it's just
moving the mouse around) its message queue will fill up. If this happens,
the app_server will start to throw away update messages and input
intended for the window, and this can cause erratic behavior by the
application.
</p><p>
Tip #5: When drawing anti-aliased text, use the proper mode
</p><p>
This is both for performance and attractiveness. If you're drawing text
on a solid color background, use the <code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code> drawing mode, and
SetLowColor to be the background color. This will look great, and be
fast. If you're drawing text on a non-solid background, to make it look
right you should use <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code>, although this can be considerably slower.
</p><p>
Tip #6: Use <code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_32_BIT</code>
</p><p>
If your view isn't very solid (for instance, if its background is a
bitmap) you'll want to <code class="methodname">SetViewColor()</code> to
<code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_32_BIT</code>. This will
prevent the app_server from wasting time clearing your view to a
background color before calling <code class="methodname">Draw()</code>, thus making updates a bit
snappier.
</p><p>
I hope these tips help you build a killer—uh, tractor user interface.
Have fun!

So, last week I went to the "Juice Patch," a local smoothie shop that
serves up drinks that don't taste like rotting fruit. I was looking for
money, so I stuck my hand in my back pocket and pulled out a $20!!
"Bonus, Dude!" I thought to myself. That's the way programming is some
times. You're going along set in your normal ways, and every once in a
while you stick your hand into those old jeans and pull out a sweet spot.
</p><p>
The wonderful thing about programming on a new OS is that there is no end
to the new things to discover. Just when you thought you were an expert,
you discover something new, or gain a fresh understanding of a particular
technique, class, or method. I've recently discovered the joys of using
the <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> class. Peter Potrebic, Be programmer extraordinaire,
has put quite a few nifty features into the BeOS in very small packages.
<code class="classname">BLooper</code>, <code class="classname">BMessage</code>,
<code class="classname">BHandler</code>, and <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> just to name a few. Peter
has already written an article on filters and could do a much better job
than I of explaining the subtle nuances of their use, but I wanted to
share a couple of my own personal favorites.
</p><p>
The well-versed BeOS programmer should know that we think threads are the
best thing on Earth. Thread programming can often times be messy and
difficult to keep straight. So the BeOS provides the <code class="classname">BLooper</code> class to
make things simple. The general idea is that a <code class="classname">BLooper</code> controls
something, and the only way to affect changes on that something is to
send a message:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">MyLooper</code>::<code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>)
</pre><p>
This method is typically implemented by anyone who wants to create a
thread of execution and receive messages. During a normal event cycle,
messages are processed by the <code class="classname">BLooper</code>'s
<code class="methodname">DispatchMessage()</code> method. It will
look for handlers to deal with the specific messages, or handle them
itself if no one else is interested.
</p><p>
So what about that fragile base class problem? Huh? Well, here's the neat
thing. During normal message processing, the <code class="classname">BLooper</code>'s
<code class="methodname">DispatchMessage()</code> is
called. The easiest thing to do if you want to catch some messages and
perform actions based on them is to sub-class the <code class="classname">BLooper</code>, or implement a
<code class="classname">BHandler</code> and add the handler to the
<code class="classname">BLooper</code>? Or is there another way?
</p><p>
Let's say I want to catch all <code class="constant">MY_FOO_BAR</code> messages that are coming into a
looper, and depending on other attributes associated with the message, I
want to dispatch it in my own special way, say across the network, or to
multiple handlers at once, what to do?
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">MyFilter</code> : public <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>

<code class="classname">MyFilter</code>::<code class="methodname">MyFilter</code>()
  : <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>(<code class="constant">MY_FOO_BAR</code>)
{
}

<span class="type">filter_result</span>
<code class="classname">MyFilter</code>::<code class="methodname">Filter</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>, <span class="type"><code class="classname">BHandler</code> **</span><code class="parameter">target</code>)
{
  <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="varname">value</code>;
  <code class="parameter">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindInt32</code>("value", &amp;<code class="varname">value</code>);

  switch(<code class="varname">value</code>)
  {
    <span class="comment">// If value is net, then distribute the message</span>
    <span class="comment">// on the net and let the system know that it has</span>
    <span class="comment">// already been dealt with.</span>
    case <em class="replaceable"><code>net</code></em>:
      <code class="methodname">DistributeOnNet</code>(<code class="parameter">msg</code>);
      return <code class="constant">B_SKIP_MESSAGE</code>;
    break;

    <span class="comment">// Distribute message locally without actually doing</span>
    <span class="comment">// anything else.</span>
    case <em class="replaceable"><code>local</code></em>:
      return <code class="constant">B_DISPATCH_MESSAGE</code>;
    break;
  }
}
</pre><p>
To Install this filter you would do something like:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">myfilter</code> = new <code class="classname">MyFilter</code>();
<code class="varname">MyLooper</code>.<code class="methodname">AddCommonFilter</code>(<code class="varname">myfilter</code>);
</pre><p>
Now, whenever your <code class="constant">MY_FOO_BAR</code> messages come in, your filter will get a
first stab at them before the rest of the framework tries to distribute
them. You didn't have to sub-class the <code class="classname">BLooper</code>
or <code class="classname">BHandler</code> classes. You
did have to sub-class <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>, but in a growing system,
sub-classing a nice small object that is unlikely to change is probably
easier than sub-classing a highly active object like <code class="classname">BWindow</code> or
<code class="classname">BApplication</code>.
</p><p>
In addition, you don't even have to sub-class <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> to get this
behavior. You can add a filter to the system using nothing more than a
function pointer. That way, as long as the API for the <code class="methodname">Filter()</code> function
remains the same, your code will never break.
</p><p>
So, yesterday evening, I was digging through my jeans again, and I found
another $20!! With a big smile on my face I placed it in my wallet, smug
in the thought that as long as I'm programming the BeOS, I'm bound to
have these positive revelations of new found wealth coming from old
familiar places. Can you believe such luck! If you're programming the
BeOS every day, then you too will experience the same fortunes no doubt,
at least that's what I see From The Front.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-36"></a>Is There An Opportunity for Us In the Confusion?</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
I am, of course, referring to the agitation around Apple's repurchase of
Power Computing's Macintosh license and the Mac cloning scene in general.
Is there an opportunity here for an end-run? In the last couple of weeks,
a number of Be-watchers have suggested the same poetic alternative: A
BeOS/<acronym class="acronym" title="Common Hardware Reference Platform">CHRP</acronym>
coalition. As one e-mailer put it:
</p><p>
"The original appeal of BeOS, the thing which made it so refreshing, was
that it was a modern OS on modern processors; while Apple behaves like
idiots, PowerPC broadens its lead. Want my money? Here's the formula:
</p><p>
Dual G3 CHRP box + BeOS + Mac Emulator = Juggernaut
</p><p>
Take my money, it's sold!"
</p><p>
Poetic, indeed...but is it the most affordably prosaic way to get Be on
your desktop?
</p><p>
Before I elaborate, a bit of context.
</p><p>
Power Computing was the first and most visible Mac cloner to graciously
host the BeOS as an additional OS for the user to install on their
system. We'll miss their spirit, the way they reinvigorated the Macintosh
community—and we'll certainly miss the exposure to their customers
that they afforded us.
</p><p>
But Power, for all its well-earned visibility, isn't the only or even the
most important channel of distribution for the BeOS. We now have bundling
agreements with magazines in the US (MacUser), Europe, and Japan totaling
over 700,000 BeOS CDs. We distributed 28,000 copies at MacWorld, we'll
hand out even more at other trade shows, and when the Preview Release
"point release" is available, we'll offer Web downloads. We'll miss
Power, but their demise doesn't signal ours.
</p><p>
So how will we survive? Another bit of context: With our next major
release, we'll have an Intel version. This isn't an uncontroversial port,
at least not to some. I found this in my mailbox last week:
</p><p>
"Face it. In the Intel space OS/2 was a June bug on NT's windshield. You
guys are a mosquito."
</p><p>
The prognosis of our undergoing the same fate as OS/2 is an opportunity
to restate our position: We're not crazy enough to think we can compete
with Windows (95 or NT, pick your death). They offer a proven,
general-purpose OS (or two), while we have a (nascent) specialized OS,
focused on digital media, as stated in a previous Newsletter:
</p><p>
http://www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue88.html#Gassee.
</p><p>
OS/2 went to battle with Windows on Windows' turf. We know better by
their example, and we know that to our intended (Intel-based) audience of
technically proficient users, adding another OS to what they already have
on their hard disk is a known exercise. We want to complement rather than
foolishly attempt to replace, and we do this in a context where users are
comfortable with the modus bootloadi.
</p><p>
So, how does this compare to CHRP space?
</p><p>
In the first place, it sounds like Apple won't support CHRP. In other
words, the CHRP platform won't be able to run the Mac OS, just the lonely
BeOS. Contrast this with the multi-OS Intel boxes—Which one will win?
The undeniable charm of the PowerPC just isn't enough.
</p><p>
Others feel the same. One of our readers, and a frequent commenter,
Philippe Dambournet, wrote to Guy Kawasaki, the distinguished Apple
Fellow and Agitpropagandist, suggesting a CHRP initiative. Guy wrote
back: "It will never happen. Too many people to get together. And it
would have an even smaller installed base/run rate than Macintosh."
</p><p>
Motorola and IBM don't seem to feel very sanguine about the PowerPC,
either. The New York Times, in today's (9/9/97) business section had this
to say: "Motorola and IBM said Monday that they were refocusing the Power
PC microprocessor family into new markets beyond the computer industry,
toward applications in consumer electronics and industrial markets."
</p><p>
The article quotes Hector Ruiz, the new President of Motorola's
Semiconductor Product Sector, as saying that Motorola is not planning a
direct competitor to Merced, the PC chip family that Intel is designing
in collaboration with Hewlett-Packard Co. The future of the
Moto/IBM/Apple alliance is, in Ruiz'words, "a work in progress."
</p><p>
For us, the situation is simple. If Motorola or IBM—preferably both --
build and market a CHRP platform, with or without a Mac OS license to
boot, we'll be happy to make sure the BeOS shines their hardware. In any
case, we'll continue with our processor-agnostic strategy, providing
developers and customers cross-platform compatibility on Intel and
PowerPC machines.
</p><p>
I also received many invitations to "comment" on Apple's recent moves,
meaning, given the tone of those messages, joining in the criticism. I
don't see how this would be helpful, or justified. I, for one, do not
believe we have the full picture of Apple's real strategy.
</p><p>
Regarding the cloners, Apple was faced with a tough choice, the same one
as they faced in '86 when the licensing idea was first agitated. Damned
if you lose the hardware business, damned if you don't license.
</p><p>
My sense is that Apple has concluded they couldn't face Wall Street while
losing the hardware business and focusing on software only. They reasoned
the cloning situation would become more and more competitive and they
would lose more and more of the juicier high-end margins because the
cloners, understandably, didn't want to focus on the low end. And CHRP
would have made the competitive situation worse.
</p><p>
I guess Apple is trying to survive while designing a new product
strategy. Seems logical. Of course, we all realize that this is, perhaps,
not a viable long term solution. But that's not our concern today.
Perhaps Apple is just buying a little time and some room to maneuver.

UI Guideline fodder. Ed Musgrove solicited opinions on some interface
matters:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Screen Resolution. Should an app accept the resolution of the
workspace in which it's launched, or should it try to find (or
create) a workspace that fits the app's expectations? For example,
should a window remember the resolution of the workspace it was last
running in and try to re-live the experience?
</p><p>
Almost everyone agreed that switching workspaces is bad—you should
almost always accept the resolution of the launched-in workspace.
Eric Berdahl fine-tuned this concept by suggesting that games or
other "immersive" user experiences should be allowed to switch
workspaces.
</p></li><li><p>
Package Data. Should collateral data (images, sounds, etc) be
stored as attributes, resources, or in completely separate files?
</p><p>
Resources by a landslide. By using resources, the app executable file
itself becomes a stand-alone package
</p></li><li><p>
User Data Byte Sex. If an app reads and writes its own data
format, should the app stick to a single endian-ness, or should it
use the native byte sex and tag the data?
</p><p>
Use network byte order, says Chris Herborth:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote"><code class="function">htons()</code>, <code class="function">htonl()</code>,
<code class="function">ntohs()</code> and <code class="function">ntohl()</code> are your friends. On
architectures that happen to correspond to network byte order,
they're empty macros; they won't add anything at all to your code. On
other machines, they usually transform into fast inline assembly.</span>”
</p><p>
The sentiment was echoed by many of our favorite listeners.
</p></li></ul><p>
Some other UI tidbits were thrown in, such as this anomaly from Timothy
Wayper:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">Launch NetPositive...Start downloading an ftp file...Close the main
browser window...Bang! You're hosed...Why? Because there's no menu on
the little FTP window to allow you to open another browser, and
NetPositive is 'single-launch', so you can't reopen the app.</span>”
</p><p>
Which led Osma Ahvenlampi to suggest that DeskBar should let you force
kill applications.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id585566"></a>Subject: Media kit, promotion, and media OS</h4></div></div></div><p>
Yann Kieffer wrote in to challenge Be to support its claim of being a
"Media OS." Specifically, Mr. Kieffer pointed out a number of
weaknesses in the audio portions of the Media Kit, most of which
centered around the lack of "higher level" (module layer) support. The
current stream layer interface is, in Mr. Kieffer's opinion, too close
to the bone to be used reliably.
</p><p>
Jon Watte responded to some of Mr. Keiffer's complaints by pointing out
that what some folks see as too low level can also be characterized as
efficient. This didn't comfort everyone—the ability to trash other
subscriber's sound output was lamented by more than one correspondent
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id585592"></a>Subject: Macintouch opinion on BeOS</h4></div></div></div><p>
A discussion of the quasi-serious suggestion (voiced in Macintouch and
elsewhere) that a combination of BeOS/CHRP could become the box for the
next generation. This led, predictably, to a discussion of PEF and
XCOFF, and questions about loading the BeOS on a Linux-bootstrapped
system.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id585609"></a>Subject: BHRP</h4></div></div></div><p>
Bernd Koester dreams of a "Be Hardware Reference Platform" that would
be eminently laptoppable. Kyle Hearn (who wants to know how you would
pronounce "BHRP"), pointed out that Be on a laptop is already available:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">You can have a BeOS laptop now, but it'll cost you about $7000 US. A
company in Canada builds laptops made with a Motorola motherboard that
they claim is BeOS compatible. The model I looked at was made from
titanium, aluminum, had a removable keyboard and an internal Jaz drive
(I'm not kidding).</span>”
</p><p>
Back to the original dream, Chris Herborth scratches his head:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">This [BHRP] would be a little... strange. BeOS is processor agnostic,
and already runs on PowerPC and Intel. At the DevCon, Erich [Ringewald,
Be's C02] mentioned they were looking into other processors, too
(mostly strange embedded stuff).</span>”
