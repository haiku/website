The "Be Newsletter" has been published weekly for seven months. In that
time, we've had a chance to review its presentation and content. You'll
notice a few changes in this week's edition:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The biggest change is in the weekly DEVELOPER PROFILE article. We've
changed the focus of the article to allow the developer's voice to be
heard more directly. Dispensing with the familiar journalistic
reportage, the profile is now presented "straight from the horse's
mouth." Even the name has changed: The profile is now called "BE
DEVELOPER TALK." Our first developer in this new presentation is Steven
Knudsen of Resolute Research Ltd.
</p></li><li><p>
A number of readers have asked that we provide more sales and
marketing information. Starting this week, you'll find a "BE MARKETING
MUTTERINGS" column that should help you understand Be's products and
marketing strategies. The column will appear biweekly.
</p></li><li><p>
Starting next week, we will provide a summary of the threads that are
taking place on the BeDevTalk discussion group. As many of you know,
BeDevTalk is an unmonitored forum where Be developers (and other
interested parties) exchange ideas, myths, suspicions, recipes, and,
occasionally, throw virtual brickbats at each other. In summarizing the
week's BeDevTalk traffic, we hope to provide a scorecard for new and
casual listeners. (To subscribe to BeDevTalk, visit the mailing list
page on our web site: http://www.be.com/about_be/mailinglists.html.)
</p></li></ul><p>
That's it! We hope you'll like the way we've revamped the newsletter. We
want to know what you think, so please send your comments and ideas to
newsletter@be.com.

Nope, sorry—this article doesn't contain advice on where to stash your
money for the highest return. But it does contain advice on making a
smart purchase of a SCSI CD-ROM drive for the current BeBox system
software.
</p><p>
The ANSI SCSI II specification does an excellent job of providing
commands for extracting data from CD-ROMs. Following the specification,
we've been able to extract data from every drive we've tested with our
SCSI CD-ROM driver.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it appears that the standards committee ran out of time in
the process of providing the same level of commands for accessing audio
tracks. While the specification does provide audio commands for playing,
pausing, accessing the table of contents, and adjusting the volume
(though different vendors have different interpretations on this), there
are no standard commands for stopping, scanning (fast- forward,
fast-reverse), and reading audio tracks. Because of this, each vendor has
chosen to implement these commands in a unique way.
</p><p>
Be's current implementation of the SCSI CD-ROM driver only offers full
support (data and audio) for the Toshiba family of drives (the 3401,
3601, and 3701). The driver only offers data and limited audio support
for other drives. If you need to extract digital audio from a CD, then
you'll need a Toshiba drive. Disregarding audio, any SCSI drive (the
cheapest you can find) should be sufficient.
</p><p>
In the future we'll provide support for more drives and make it simpler
to add support for others. We'll do this by redesigning our current
driver to use "add-ons" for audio access (currently, all audio access is
done in the driver, which is linked into the kernel and not easily
replaceable). We'll publish the API for CD-ROM add-ons so developers and
vendors can also add support for additional drives.

All I could think when I first saw a BeBox was, "Gee! It sure would have
come in handy for my Ph.D.!"
</p><p>
My wife, Katherine, and I started Resolute Research in 1994. We develop
custom scientific and engineering solutions including signal processing,
data analysis and manipulation, communications, and embedded
microsystems. It's pretty much right down our alley, because I've got a
Ph.D. in multidimensional signal processing and Katherine's a petroleum
engineer.
</p><p>
Be has me as excited as the day my first full-blown Mac application ran.
For an electrical/computer engineer, the BeBox is a "must-have" platform.
Its combination of a brand new OS and development environment, a
flexible, open hardware architecture, and accessibility to the entire
system from the external signal/board level on up is unique.
</p><p>
Like all developers, I want to see the BeBox achieve a significant
customer base in the long run, but for now, for the markets we serve, I
see it as a very practical platform upon which to base powerful, new,
vertical market solutions. The <span class="trademark">GeekPort</span>™ in particular is ideal for
prototyping electronic circuits in signal processing and robot projects.
I'm dying to try some of my nonlinear adaptive filtering algorithms in
real-time!
</p><p>
The more I work with the BeBox, the more ideas spring to mind. The
problem is deciding what to focus on first! Right now, I'm spending most
of my time learning the system. And I've started on a port of the NCSA's
Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), with an eye toward using it as the basis
of a multidimensional data manipulation and analysis library and
application.
</p><p>
Further down the road we'll be working on microcontroller development
tools, primarily for the PIC family of microcontrollers. The GeekPort is
a natural fit. A possible first application would involve the control of
household electronic equipment and monitoring household functions using
the BeBox's IR ports and an IR transceiver, built around a PIC. It's also
the first step in developing and controlling autonomous and
semi-autonomous mobile robots.
</p><p>
Longer term? We're looking at projects centered on signal processing
applications. Initially, some sort of basic DSP framework, and after
that, some state-of-the-art, one- dimensional and multidimensional signal
processing algorithms. Motion detection and tracking in digitized video
are particularly interesting.
</p><p>
Our database libraries should be available by mid-summer 1996, with the
DSP environment and associated applications coming in late 1996. We wish
it were sooner, but, like so many small consulting companies, we've been
busier satisfying customer contracts than developing our own products.
</p><p>
Actually, that's not entirely true. Katherine has, after nine months of
development, produced our finest product to date: Baby Knud Soren
Knudsen! I lobbied for a name that included "Be-something," but being
only Vice President , I was voted down...

The lifeblood of any company is communication, between its customers,
partners, suppliers, employees, friends, and shareholders (with, we hope,
significant overlap among these groups). The primary function of a
marketing organization is CONNECTION: To lubricate, stimulate, and
participate in the connections between customers and engineers,
developers and managers, and others. To aid in forming and maintaining
those connections, we're going to use this space in the newsletter every
two weeks to write about goings on at Be and in the Be community. True
communication is, by its very nature, bidirectional, so send me feedback,
comments, criticisms, and suggestions (to alex@be.com).
</p><p>
Startup companies live by only one credo: Product. Those that don't live
by that credo don't live. So, for the past five years, Be has focused on
developing its product and turning it into something ready for the market
—or at least ready for application developers, who will help us turn it
into something ready for end users. As the product neared developer
readiness, Be hired a few people to focus on getting that product out to
the developer market. As a recent hire myself, I am simultaneously
excited by the product and what it could do and somewhat wistful at
having missed the company's first five years of hard work and
satisfaction; there's nothing quite like being in at the beginning of
something great and seeing it grow. However, there was a reason why Be
didn't hire a salesperson five years ago: The company is resisting the
allure of the quick buck and—gasp—is selling what it has today
rather than what it will have someday in the future.
</p><p>
So what is the purpose of the freshly minted sales and marketing team,
hired over the past few months? The answer is simple: To help developers
ship successful applications on the Be OS. Our priorities are to provide
technical and marketing support to developers, to assist in connecting
developers with potential customers, and to manage the logistics of
buying, shipping, and (occasionally) fixing machines. In the past week, I
hope that every developer who has applied to join our developer program
has heard back from us (if not, please let me know). BeBoxes are
available immediately to all developers. Now is the time to start
developing your application! To help fulfill our promises of support,
we're hiring evangelists: Highly technical people who can work alongside
a developer to get applications out. Those are the only people we're
hiring this year into the sales and marketing organization. If you know
of someone, or have a yearning to evangelize the BeBox and Be OS, we'll
roll out the red carpet for you.
</p><p>
Keep in touch.

The term "evangelism" was coined by Steve Jobs at Apple, in the pirate
flag days of the Macintosh division. At the time, the Holy Grail was
getting application software for the Macintosh. The Apple /// wasn't
working too well, the Apple II was running out of hardware, and the Lisa
was destined to disappear after being rechristened Mac XL (for Xtra Large
or eX Lisa...). The adversary at the time was IBM, positioned as Big
Brother in the 1984 Ridley Scott commercial. The polarization was
effective. IBM still reigned and had done a terrific job in establishing
themselves as the winner in the battle for the PC market, or so said the
"Business Week" cover story. At the time, little did we know that the
real winner lived inside the PC: Microsoft would end up dominating both
the operating system and office application markets.
</p><p>
I have two problems with the implications of the word evangelism—even
if I agree to bow to usage.
</p><p>
The first problem is with the religious implications. More precisely, the
intolerance often associated with evangelical religion. I'd rather not
see our company behave in a rigid fashion and belittle "nonbelievers."
There are many ways in the Lord's House, and I'd like to present ours as
one way—not The way—to exciting new technologies, markets, and
applications. Which leads me to the second problem: Polarization. Yes,
after seeing the famous commercial and the Macintosh descend from the
sky, Steve Jobs' depicting IBM as the oppressor of personal computing
freedom focused emotions. But, as we know now, that was at the expense of
intellect. One's opinions on who was the real adversary may vary, but it
wasn't IBM.
</p><p>
Polarization makes good PR, but it doesn't necessarily make good sense
after the newspapers are recycled. Yes, some say they'll work with us
because we aren't this company or that one. If it's because we offer
features, market space, or services not easily accessible through other
associations, we have a sound basis for a partnership. We'll also take
style or chemistry: Even the computer business is still conducted by
humans. But we'd rather appeal to positive aspirations such as
innovating, building, and sharing. Does this make us naive? On the
contrary. We have high aspirations for this company, and we'd rather
build it on positive foundations with like-minded partners. Still, we
have competition, which will intensify as we gain momentum. This is no
excuse for facile polarization. I'd rather follow the "two Bills" school
of coaching. Outside the company: Bill Walsh. We're playing against a
great team, it will be a tough game. If you win, you beat a great team --
if you lose, you lost against a great opponent. Inside the company: Bill
Gates, always on the watch for threats and opportunities.
</p><p>
So, we'll strive for good deeds, we'll speak well of our partners and
competitors, and we'll keep our dark thoughts to ourselves. What about
evangelism, then? Many things have changed since that term was coined.
Even if the stated goal is the same—to get applications on the
platform—even if Guy Kawasaki's book, "The Macintosh Way," has
withstood the passage of time, much of the context has changed. Great
development tools, a simpler platform, and electronic distribution of
software have simplified the business model of application development on
the BeBox.
</p><p>
As a result, we're singly focused on establishing relationships with
authors who'll produce good code—not business plans. We want
evangelists who can sell the benefits of the platform, stay on the
relationship, and provide at least the first level of technical support
to their developers. It seems a tall order, but we believe the benefits
to be even taller. Just as we say better products are developed if more
decisions reside inside a single human head, we'll have a better
relationship with each developer if technical and business discussions
are held with a single Be human. We'll advertise for several evangelist
positions. Given our requirements, we're also likely to use a search
firm. But if you know an MBA who can write and debug C++ code, let us
know, let him or her know. You might help a great application be born and
you'll certainly help this young company.
