On my way home last night I passed under highway 280 on Alpine Road. It
wasn't a momentous or meaningful occasion—I drive that way home almost
every night—but you see there is a pothole under the bridge that looks
a little like Clarus the dogcow (aka "Moof"). Passing over it and
marveling at the randomness of the universe that would causes a pothole
in the shape of a famous Page Setup dialog box icon to be created is just
one of the little things that I'll miss about working at Be. He's been
there for a while now, and with the erosion of the road surface he's put
on a little weight.
</p><p>
I can't say why that sticks in my mind today, but this afternoon as I
drove back from Mountain View, where I registered a domain name for my
new venture, I was reminded of the feelings I had 18 years ago moving out
of my mother's home in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to make my future in
California. As I drove my '69 Red VW Van, "Fritz," down Highway 1, I was
overcome with mixed feelings. When I looked in the rear view mirror I
felt remorse and loss and felt an urge to drive back and throw out the
anchor in Green Bay, but the future was there in the windshield. Up there
I had a wide-screen view of a starkly new world. Warm air caressed my
arms through the open windows, assailing my nose with sea, dirt, and
flowers. The roar of the Pacific called to me, "Hey! where have you been
all your life?"
</p><p>
With every corner I felt a flush of life, newness, and anticipation. I
had this cassette tape that my friend John had made for me. When I passed
Big Sur I plugged it into the player, having saved it for just that
moment. The Grateful Dead's Estimated Prophet
<sup>[<a id="id547021" href="#ftn.id547021" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>
came pouring forth. I never felt more alive. I was home.
</p><p>
Be is leaving the hardware business, and I am leaving Be, and how do I
feel? I feel good. I feel good because it's the right thing for Be to do.
You as developers should feel good about it too, because it means that Be
is determined to make decisions that will benefit the long-term viability
of the BeOS, and your BeOS applications. Be has proven that it's willing
to stop doing something when it stops making sense. As someone personally
affected by this decision, I think it is my place to say that this is a
remarkably rare virtue these days. I'm very proud of the work I've done
for Be and consider it to be the best work I've ever done, but now my job
here is done. The <span class="trademark">BeBox</span>™ gave the BeOS a safe nursery at a time when
other platforms were far more hostile to yet another (unproven) OS. The
BeBox proved to be a pedestal on which to display the capabilities of the
OS. Those of you who've been frightened
<sup>[<a id="id547039" href="#ftn.id547039" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>
by my demos will remember that
I've always stressed that the software is the most important thing, and
that the hardware was only there to run the software. Now the BeOS has
found its way to the Power Mac, and thousands of new developers can see
what the shouting is all about. (Hint: It's the OS, stupid.)
</p><p>
I like to make up metaphors, as Jean Louis will attest, and this one
comes to mind today. On a warm summer night in 1969, I stood in my yard
in northern Minnesota and looked at the moon. There was no traffic that
night, and every house in view was darkened, but lit from within by the
bluish glow of televisions tuned to Tranquillity base. A few days earlier
a Saturn rocket had lifted from the Kennedy space center, a noisy
necessity to putting man on the moon. The booster did its job and placed
the rest of the ship in low earth orbit. Then its job was done, and the
attention of the world turned to the moon. I like to think that the BeBox
is in some way related to that thunderous booster. Its job of lifting
both Be and the BeOS safely into orbit is complete, but the focus must
now be on the OS and applications. While it might be romantic for a
little company to be in the computer hardware business (let's stretch
this metaphor till it creaks), think of the odds of success for our hero,
Mr. Armstrong, should he have elected to bring that booster along with
him to the Sea of Tranquillity.
</p><p>
For those of you wondering what I might be up to next, I'm now dreaming
the Silicon Valley dream and will be putting together my first start up.
I'd always planned to start my own company one day when Be was
successful, but now with Be leaving the hardware business, I guess today
is a good day to start a new business.
</p><p>
I'm not prepared to go public with my product plans, but my new venture
is called "Video Storage Systems," so you may safely guess it involves
video hardware, and yes it will work with the BeBox. I haven't gotten
confirmation on my new domain name yet so I won't reveal it, but those of
you interested can watch for an announcement on my personal home page
full of Ranma 1/2 Fan fictions: http://www.best.com/~jpalmer
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering2-5-2"></a>Be Engineering Insights: Graphics Drivers Are Hardware Devices Too</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Scott</span> <span class="surname">Bronson</span></span></div></div></div><p>
First, an introduction. Consider for a moment the expressive simplicity
of a file. A wide number of things in this world, both conceptual and
physical, can be expressed in terms of open, close, read, write, and
seek. And, of course, ioctl fills in any metaphor imperfections. Eek!
Maybe I'd better get outside, but not until I explore this further.
</p><p>
Device drivers are particularly well suited for a file metaphor. All
hardware devices need to be opened and closed. Reading, writing, and
seeking are optional but useful when the metaphor fits. In fact, you can
see that the BeOS has been tending in this direction for years. In DR8
and previously, to open serial port 2, you:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">fd</code> = <code class="function">open</code>( "/dev/serial2", <code class="constant">O_RDWR</code> );
</pre><p>
This will be fully realized in DR9. <code class="filename">/dev/serial2</code> will no longer be a
pseudo-pathname. Finally the <code class="filename">/dev</code> directory will be a complete and
upstanding member of the DR9 file system. You'll be able to use POSIX
calls, the BeOS file system API, and even shell commands to manipulate
devices. For instance, to list all installed serial ports:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ ls -l /dev/serial
  crwxrwxrwx  1 elvis  0  0,  0  Jan 30 16:33  Modem Port
  crwxrwxrwx  1 elvis  0  0,  0  Jan 30 16:33  Printer Port
</pre><p>
Even though these aren't files, their charade is very convincing. There
are only two differences to notice here. In the first column, where 'd'
normally indicates a directory and '-' a file, 'c' indicates a character
device and 'b' indicates block. Also, these files appear to be zero bytes
in size. Were you to open one, however, you would find that reading and
writing would work as expected and seeking would be ignored.
</p><p>
As an example, say it's nighttime, and for now you want your modem to
operate silently. If your modem or terminal program didn't come with this
feature (most don't), have no fear. Using the shell to send the modem the
appropriate AT command is as simple as:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd /dev/serial
$ echo "AT &amp;M0" &gt; "Modem Port"
</pre><p>
To save typing and memorization, this would fit nicely into an alias or
shell script. Flexible, simple, standard. I love it.
</p><p>
Another great DR9 benefit is that graphics drivers will move back into
the kernel, rejoining their driver siblings. This allows graphics drivers
to service and synch to VBLs, perform DMA, respond to drawing-completed
interrupts, and do just about anything else that would be expected of any
self- respecting driver. This, of course, means that the boot process
will be quite different.
</p><p>
When the kernel is starting up, it asks each driver in the
<code class="filename">/system/drivers</code> directory to
install itself. The driver will interrogate
the system, installing one entry per hardware device found into the
<code class="filename">/dev</code>
directory. All graphics drivers will ask to be installed into
<code class="filename">/dev/graphics</code>, serial drivers into
<code class="filename">/dev/serial</code>, and so on.
</p><p>
For example, assume a particularly well-equipped system has a TwinTurbo
128 and two Xclaim VR cards installed. The IMS driver will find its card
and create its "TwinTurbo 128"
<code class="filename">/dev/graphics</code> device. The ATI driver will
find the two Xclaim VR cards and install a unique entry for each. All
other graphics drivers in <code class="filename">/system/drivers</code> (S3, Cirrus, and so on) won't
find appropriate hardware and therefore won't install anything into
<code class="filename">/dev</code>.
This would be the result:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ ls -l /dev/graphics
  crwxrwxrwx  1 elvis  0  0,  0  Jan 30 16:33  TwinTurbo 128
  crwxrwxrwx  1 elvis  0  0,  0  Jan 30 16:33  Xclaim VR (Slot A1)
  crwxrwxrwx  1 elvis  0  0,  0  Jan 30 16:33  Xclaim VR (Slot B4)
</pre><p>
Later in the boot process, the Application Server starts up and opens and
uses the graphics devices found in <code class="filename">/dev/graphics</code>. It will not, however,
coddle them as it has in the past. The driver will now (as appropriate)
have to enable its device's PCI spaces, initialize its hardware, and even
map its own memory spaces. Don't worry, we'll tell you how.
</p><p>
Notice that nowhere in this process has a PCI-centric assumption been
made. Feel like getting that dusty ISA VGA card working? Remember those
early PowerBook SCSI displays? The possibilities are wide open.
</p><p>
All interaction with a graphics driver will be through ioctl. Read and
write will do nothing. In addition to the standard <code class="methodname">Get/SetRaster</code>,
<code class="methodname">Get/SetIndexedColor</code> and <code class="methodname">Get/SetGamma</code> requests, we'll include
<code class="methodname">Get/SetPowerState</code> for VESA power management and GetSense for Apple Cable
Sense. VESA's DDC (Display Data Channel) won't make it into DR9, but
we'll leave room for it.
</p><p>
An important distinction: The kernel driver only sets up the frame
buffer; it doesn't draw. Drawing using hardware acceleration is finicky,
difficult, and subject to very different requirements than kernel
graphics drivers. Therefore, another piece of code will be called upon to
draw. The final acceleration architecture won't be in place when DR9
ships, so we'll have to continue to put up with the copious synching
performed by DR8 for now. But don't worry, we won't have to put up with
it for long.
</p><p>
We'll include a compatibility driver that will support all loyal DR8
drivers, easing DR9 adoption. Don't hesitate to start using that
Millenium or Trio64V+ card; its driver will continue to work.
</p><p>
Is it any wonder I'm excited?

My daughter has had this one comfort since birth. It's a multicolored
segmented snake. Its name is Annie. My daughter likes to hold onto it
because of the neat colors, and some of the segments make a crinkly
sounds or have bells in them.
</p><p>
We like her to experience new things, though. So we've introduced her to
new toys which don't have the same features as Annie. Usually she's a bit
reluctant at the start, but then she really warms up to it and has a good
time. One of her current favorites is this four-wheel car thing that she
can ride around the house with the help of some people power... Put your
feet up... Wheee. By embracing the car, she's found that she can go more
places and have more fun than she could with Annie alone. Annie still
serves her purpose but has been relegated to night duty in her crib.
</p><p>
And so... This week, as promised, we have new serial support for the
Power Mac version of the BeOS. When the MacTech CD went out, we didn't
have support for PPP because we didn't quite get the serial driver
working by the time the CD needed to be pressed. Since then, many users
have lamented the fact that they couldn't connect to the Internet from
their new BeOS Power Mac. Well, now we remedy the situation. The caveats:
</p><p>
Truly supported PPP won't really be available until DR9. That's to say,
we're anxious to hear how things are going for you, but our main work is
concentrating on DR9, so if there's an obscure problem, it may not be
fixed until DR9.
</p><p>
PPP has been tested with a few modems on a few Macs, but we haven't done
extensive testing with all configurations. Here you can possibly help us.
When you have a configuration that works, let us know.
</p><p>
You must have a thick skin and patience to use a developer's release, and
this software is offered in the same spirit.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr8_update/macserial.tgz
</p><p>
Before joining Be I did a lot of BeOS software that ended up at my own
Web site and never at the Be ftp site. One of the pieces that I did was
called the esoteric library. This was a library of things that are useful
for programming in C++. I want to use these thingies in some of our
tutorials, so I'm bringing them into the fold.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/bebits.tgz
</p><p>
Take a look. Utilities, sorting algorithms, container classes, that sort
of thing. Of course the standard C++ library will cover some of it, but
not all of it.
</p><p>
Geoff Woodcock is at it again. Geoff has a wild hair to do networking
stuff, and he wanted to create a tutorial that was fun and showed off
networking. So he's come up with this multi-user drawing thingy that
allows you to do drawing over the net. The tutorial will not be available
until next week some time, but I thought I'd mention it anyway. We'll be
working on three or four more DR8-specific tutorials before we move on to
preparing for DR9.
</p><p>
And how do we get to DR9? Well, last week I sort of hinted at wanting get
apps up and running before DR9 actually ships out the door. What I'm
thinking is that we want to have a porting lab. That is, an opportunity
for developers to come to Be a little before DR9 ships to port their
wares. I think we can benefit from having apps ported before DR9 shows
up, so we don't have to send out a disk with only our demos available. We
want to highlight the work of our third-party developers and give them
early exposure, and I see this as an excellent opportunity.
</p><p>
So if you think you would want to participate in such an event, please
send me e-mail (wadams@be.com). It promises to be an exciting time, and
no doubt you'll have a lot of fun being the first on the block. No dates
or other details have been set yet, but we want to know whether it's
worth pursuing. Of course space will be extremely limited, so only think
about coming if you absolutely want to get early exposure.
</p><p>
As DR9 approaches, we'll see some of our developers turn toward seriously
commercializing their products. One thing that the Be platform has
offered is extremely high exposure for the smaller developer. But there's
one thing missing. Small developers want to code. Some of them want to
run companies and become big developers. For those who don't want to make
the big time, but want to be rewarded for their efforts, shareware is
often an option. Others will want to go with a more traditional
publishing route, with advertising and the like.
</p><p>
One of the things that Be Developer Services can do is help developers
bring their products to fruition. That is, helping with suggestions on
commercialization, helping put developers in contact with publishers, and
helping put together partners that make sense.
</p><p>
So you can look forward to our getting more into your business if that's
what you desire. Our mission isn't only to help you program but to make
sure that the fruits of your labors bring you commercial success.

Be runs six e-mail mailing lists. You can learn about the nuts and bolts
of what they are, how to subscribe and unsubscribe, and other information
on the Be Web site:
</p><p>
http://www.be.com/aboutbe/mailinglists.html
</p><p>
The recent publicity surrounding Be in the wake of Macworld Expo at the
beginning of the year has lead to a significant increase in the number of
people subscribed to our various mailing lists. With this increase in
subscribers, we've started receiving a larger number of questions about
the lists that aren't necessarily covered by the Web page.
</p><p>
I'm the guy who gets to answer all those questions.
</p><p>
So I'd like to tell you a bit about the lists, some recent history, why
certain things happen, and what's going to change in the coming month or
two.
</p><p>
First of all, the server itself is a PowerMac 7100/80 running ListSTAR
1.1, from Star*Nine/QuarterDeck. Under normal circumstances, this
combination is more than capable of handling the dozens to hundreds of
messages that go out to several hundred subscribers every day.
</p><p>
Over the holidays and through Macworld, the server developed some disk
and preferences problems and was crashing on a very regular basis,
resulting in delayed mail to list subscribers. This was, to say the
least, very irritating, but a complete rebuild of the server three weeks
ago has greatly improved stability.
</p><p>
Also during Macworld, Be sent four press releases to the BeInfo list from
a machine in our booth on the show floor. Some quirk in the show network
apparently resulted in each of the messages being sent multiple times. It
wasn't the list server's fault, it actually received the messages
multiple times and faithfully sent them on.
</p><p>
More recently, and probably due to the bombardment that happened during
Macworld, people have been noticing and commenting that they receive more
than one copy of the Be Newsletter each week. These comments generally
come to Valerie Peyre, the Newsletter's editor, and it was she that
dragooned, er, suggested I write an article explaining the phenomenon.
</p><p>
When a person receives multiple copies of the Be Newsletter, it's
generally for a simple reason: They're subscribed to more than one Be
mailing list, and each list was sent a copy of the Newsletter. The person
receives one copy from each list (I receive four copies of the Newsletter
each week!).
</p><p>
You can see that this is happening by examining the "To:" field of each
message. The four lists to which the Newsletter is sent each week should
have unique "To:" field entries:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>List Name</th><th>"To:" Field</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BeInfo</td><td>beinfo@be.com</td></tr><tr><td>BeDevNews</td><td>bedevnews@be.com</td></tr><tr><td>BeUserGroup</td><td>beusergroup@be.com</td></tr><tr><td>BeResellerNews</td><td>beresellernews@be.com</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Of course, a reasonable person might suggest that there's no reason to
receive multiple copies of the Newsletter, even if subscribed to multiple
lists. Indeed, I agree! Later this month I will test and implement a
separate, hidden list just for sending out the Be Newsletter.
</p><p>
Once this solution is working you should receive one copy of the Be
Newsletter—no more, no less. Then hopefully people won't feel as
though Be is mail bombing them. At least, not until this fall's Macworld
Expo in Boston.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-5"></a>Exiting the Hardware Business</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Let me start with an apology. When we stated we'd provide software
support for BeBoxes for at least 12 months, we got our just desserts, a
swift e-mail lashing. We saw the errors of our ways and will provide
software support for at least 3 years. I apologize for the frustration we
created, and I am grateful for the feedback and for the opportunity to
quickly correct the situation.
</p><p>
Now, why do we exit the hardware business? When we started Be,
multiprocessing didn't exist on desktop PCs, only on servers. Once you've
paid for the entire infrastructure of a personal computer, we thought,
the cost of one or a small number of processors is but a modest addition
to the whole bill of materials. More important, perhaps, we thought
symmetric multiprocessing, SMP, a type of architecture where all
processors are used in the same fashion, couldn't be felicitously
retrofitted on a design. To work well, to offer all the benefits it
promised, SMP had to be designed in from the very beginning.
</p><p>
So, we designed SMP hardware. With the AT&amp;T Hobbit at first; the PowerPC
didn't exist then, and AT&amp;T's processor was fast and inexpensive. Fast,
but not exceedingly fast. This started us on healthy habits of getting
good performance from less than turbo-compressed hardware. When the
PowerPC appeared and AT&amp;T helped us move to our new target, we enjoyed
the sudden boost, even on the slowest member of the PowerPC family, the
66 MHz 603.
</p><p>
Later, a strange idea came to us: Porting our software to the
highest-volume PowerPC design, the family of Power Macs and clones. As a
result, Be developers gained a broader playing field, and we started a
happy partnership with Power Computing. Not only did our young OS shine
on a larger number of machines, but multiprocessor Power Macs moved out
of the system software orphanage. Previously, they were condemned to
hacked applications. Neither the OS nor standard applications could use
the extra hardware. On the Be platform, all software automatically
benefits from more processors. A four-processor DayStar machine draws
strong reactions from the audience, achieving more impressive performance
than much costlier workstations.
</p><p>
We were watching two trends. First, the total value of our software to
all participants, developers, users, hardware partners, and ourselves
increases with the number of users. Not really a surprise, but our
migrating to the Power Mac family accomplished such an increase. Second,
and speaking of the Power Mac family, there is now a healthy Mac clone
community. To wit, a MacWeek story
(http://www.macweek.com/mw_1105/nw_sales.html), in which Pieter Hartsook,
Apple vice president of marketing analysis and research, estimated that
clone vendors shipped 100,000 to 120,000 machines during the fourth
quarter. We came to feel there was little we brought to the PowerPC camp
now that MP machines were available and more accepted.

So we decided to focus on software and on doing whatever we could to help
the PowerPC build momentum. Of course, we're aware of our minuscule size;
a 55-person company in Menlo Park can't influence the PowerPC platform as
much as its largest player, Apple. But we feel we can do the most good by
focusing our resources on adding value to the largest possible number of
PowerPC machines.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it's not that simple. On the human side, we're losing Joe
Palmer, our Director of Hardware Engineering. Joe's fine work put us in
orbit. He himself uses the booster rocket metaphor to describe the role
the BeBox played for the Be community. We'll miss Joe's presence, his
work, his endless supply of metaphors, especially ones that require
lengthy explanations for this immigrant, his demonstrations. We get to
keep the memories and the good feeling of being in the debt of such a
classy man.

More desktop UI talk:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Should all app menus be collected into a centralized location so
you can, for example, switch among them quickly? What if there are
tens or hundreds of apps running?
</p></li><li><p>
Should the method for making a running (and possibly idle)
application be the active application be different from launching the
application in the first place?
</p></li><li><p>
Certain GUI functions could be split between separate handler and
"displayer" apps. For example, a Web browser could be divided into a
net-crawling, image-caching back end, and an HTML-displaying front
end. Fronts and backs could be mixed and matched.
</p></li><li><p>
The BeOS should have "zoomable" process control. You could zoom
out to see all apps, zoom in to see just user apps, zoom in more to
see the threads of a certain team, and so on.
</p></li></ul><p>
The GUI discussions spilled into mutli-user land. Specifically, the
evilness of root (or "administrator") was debated. But, some folks
wondered, how do you create a secure multi-user system without a root
permission level? Delegating permission seems to be popular: Power is
distributed among (as Loren Wilton put it)...

AKA: Very, very, very Bad Be...<br />
AKA: No more BeBox HW - whence MIDI?<br />
AKA: Good Audio<br />
[and others]
</h5></div></div></div><p>
The hot topic of the week was the announcement that Be is getting out
of the hardware business. A number of developers were understandably
agitated by this move; some characterized it as a betrayal. Others
mourned the passing of the BeBox but saw it as an economic
inevitability. And there was even some scattered applause to commend
the decision.
</p><p>
Some specific (and relatively unemotional) topics:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)<br />
Be's platform support will naturally need to be more generic. Will
this make Be see that hard-wiring parts of the kernel to support
specific platforms is a bad idea? Dominic Giampaolo briefly described
Be's plan to move platform-specific components (file systems and
CPUs in particular) out of the kernel—it's not a full-fledged HAL
(yet), but it's headed in the right direction.
</p></li><li><p>
MIDI<br />
Are built-in MIDI ports necessary? It was pointed out that (A) the
Mac is the platform of choice for MIDI applications, and it doesn't
have built-in ports, (B) a professional studio setup needs more than
two ports anyway, and (C) PIOS will offer plenty of "music-friendly"
IO hardware.
</p></li><li><p>
"CD-Quality" Audio<br />
The loss of quality audio hardware was lamented. This was countered
by the claim that Macintosh audio hardware is pretty much the same as
what you get with a BeBox; none of it lives up to professional studio
standards, but it's more than good enough for general-purpose use.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id547975"></a>Subject: let's talk about cursors</h4></div></div></div><p>
Performing context-sensitive cursor switching is difficult because
there's no "the mouse has left the building" message. It was proposed
that Be provide a <code class="methodname">MouseExited()</code> call back
(plus a <code class="methodname">GetCursor()</code> so the
old cursor image can be remembered and restored when the mouse exits).
Two primary objections:
</p><p>
Objection #1: Every Exit is complemented by an Enter in some other
window (the Tracker if you exit to the desktop)—why not just let the
Enter do the work? This means that every window or view should set the
cursor to the image that it needs; if there's no handler in a view, the
default image is used.
</p><p>
Objection #2: There's no way to guarantee that the <code class="methodname">MouseExit()</code> will run
before the concomittant <code class="methodname">MouseEntered()</code>
so the user may end up with the wrong cursor.
</p><p>
Another proposal: Provide cursor regsitration and let the Application
Server change the cursor as the mouse moves around.
</p><p>
Objection: You can't (easily) perform cursor image processing or other
dynamic cursor updating.

There is no "official" Be bitmap data format; Jon Ragnarsson wrote in
to propose that PNG (Portable Network Graphics) be sanctioned as such.
This was met with general acceptance, although there were some
questions about the speed of compression and decompression.
</p><p>
For more on PNG, see http://www.wco.com/~png or
http://www.boutell.com/boutell/png/png.html.
</p><p>
The status quo Be screen dump format and the DATA_BITMAP datatype were
also proposed as possible standards.
</p><p>
More philosophically the question was raised, "what's a standard for?"
It was suggested that a standard is meaningful only when data crosses
application boundaries; within an app, you can do whatever you want.
