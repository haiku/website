Recently, Ficus Kirkpatrick and I were musing about how to combine what
he was working on (video stuff) with what I was working on (printing). My
suggestion, something along the lines of finding a 60-page-per-second
printer, was put down soundly. Ficus had a better idea: How about a
little application to generate flipbooks from movie files? I was
intrigued. So, with a little schooling about the new <code class="classname">BMediaFile</code> and
<code class="classname">BMediaTrack</code> classes from Jeff Bush, a newsletter article was born:
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/interface_kit/flipbook.zip&gt;
</p><p>
Open the source code and follow along!
</p><p>
To use this little app, you'll need at least one movie, preferably one
that shows a lot of motion. Drop the movie onto the app's window (or open
it through the file panel). Notice the Print Information box. The first
item, "Number of flip pages," tells you how many flip pages will be
printed out. This is controlled by the "Print one frame per..." text
control: printing one frame per 2, say, will print every other frame of
the movie. The next item, "Flip pages per printed page," lets you know
how many flip pages can be tiled onto a single printed page. This is
affected by the paper size you choose in Page Setup. Finally, "Number of
printed pages" does the arithmetic for you, showing how many pages this
little movie will cost you. The "Generate" button produces and prints the
flipbook.
</p><p>
Even if you don't have a printer, you can still have fun: just create a
Preview printer to see what the pages look like. Using the Preview
printer is also a useful way to see if your flipbook has enough, or too
many, pages, without wasting lots of time and paper. (To create a Preview
printer, go to the Printers Preferences panel, click "Add...," choose
"Local Printer" and press "Continue," and select "Preview" from the
"Printer Type" menu.)
</p><p>
The sample code uses a few features of the <code class="classname">BPrintJob</code> class that are new
to R4.5. <code class="methodname">PageRect()</code> and <code class="methodname">PrintableRect()</code>
can now be called on <code class="classname">BPrintJob</code>s
which haven't been set up yet, either through the user running
<code class="methodname">PageSetup()</code>, or through a call to
<code class="methodname">SetSettings()</code>. In this case, these
functions return the printer's default Page rectangle and the printer's
default Printable rectangle. This is how we can suggest "Number of flip
pages per printed page" even though the user hasn't yet run Page Setup --
we're using the printer's default Printable rectangle. (I won't go into
how this is implemented on the printer driver side. If you're writing a
printer driver, contact me for details.)
</p><p>
A new <code class="classname">BPrintJob</code> function that wasn't used in this sample code is
<code class="methodname">GetResolution()</code>, which returns the printer's resolution in the horizontal
and vertical directions. Like <code class="methodname">PageRect()</code> and
<code class="methodname">PrintableRect()</code>, it returns
the printer driver's default settings if the <code class="classname">BPrintJob</code> has not yet been
set up, and the user-selected resolution if it has been set up.
</p><p>
You'll also notice a new message being caught in
<code class="classname">FlipApp</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived()</code>:
<code class="constant">B_PRINTER_CHANGED</code>. In R4.5, this message is
broadcast to all running applications when the user switches the default
printer through the Printers Preferences panel, allowing applications to
handle this change. Applications should, at a minimum, discard the
previous printer's settings message and call <code class="methodname">ConfigPage()</code> the next time
the user invokes printing, rather than going directly to <code class="methodname">ConfigJob()</code>.
</p><p>
The application itself is straightforward. After receiving an entry ref,
either from the Open dialog or through a drag-n-drop message, we open it
through <code class="classname">BMediaFile</code>. We then step through the
<code class="classname">BMediaTrack</code>s, looking for
one of type <code class="constant">B_MEDIA_ENCODED_VIDEO</code>. Upon finding such a track, we create a
bitmap of the appropriate size, and tell the <code class="classname">BMediaTrack</code> that when we ask
for a frame of video, it should return raw video. This "asking for a
frame" occurs when we call <code class="classname">BMediaTrack</code>::<code class="methodname">ReadFrame()</code>, where we pass in the
aforementioned bitmap, which is populated with the video frame. Playing
the movie, then, is nothing but a loop of calls to <code class="methodname">ReadFrame()</code> followed
by <code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code>. (See <code class="classname">FlipView</code>::<code class="methodname">GenerateFlipbook()</code>.)
</p><p>
One way that Flipbook differs from most applications is that the
"document" as such doesn't exist before we print. In fact, we don't even
create a whole page before it is printed: doing so would needlessly
consume memory (a full page of 32-bit bitmaps is costly!). Instead, we do
it piecemeal: given a video frame, we create a flipbook page, determine
where this flipbook page should be placed on the printed page, and then
call <code class="classname">BPrintJob</code>::<code class="methodname">DrawView()</code>.
</p><p>
In <code class="methodname">DrawView()</code>, the <code class="classname">BPrintJob</code>
writes the drawing commands which describe
this flipbook page out to the spool file, along with the <code class="classname">BPoint</code> which
determines where it is to be placed on the printed page. We can create
the document this way, piece-by-piece, because until
<code class="classname">BPrintJob</code>::<code class="methodname">SpoolPage()</code> is called, the
<code class="classname">BPrintJob</code> is working only on one
page, regardless of how many <code class="methodname">DrawView()</code> commands are issued.
</p><p>
As always, I encourage you to twist the code to suit your own purposes.
The illustrious Miss Melanie Walker informs me that there are companies
that produce heavy, perforated paper specifically designed for making
flipbooks. I haven't had a chance to find such paper yet, but if you do,
you'll probably need to tweak the Layout code to match the perforation
marks. (Don't be afraid to call <code class="methodname">SetScale()</code>, in combination with
<code class="methodname">GetResolution()</code>, to get just the right size image.) Enjoy!

On the internet there is beer but no god. I found this out the other
night when I was typing random domain names into NetPositive.
<a class="ulink" href="http://beer.com/">Beer.com</a> is
the "official beer of the internet."
<a class="ulink" href="http://god.com/">God.com</a> draws a blank. However,
there is a <a class="ulink" href="http://jesus.com">Jesus.com</a>
("New Chat Services Available!"), and a
<a class="ulink" href="http://buddha.com/">Buddha.com</a>,
which takes you to an online shopping site. In an emergency, visit
<a class="ulink" href="http://angels.com/">angels.com</a>:
"This site is for emergency response when a disaster occurs
and fellow human beings are in extreme danger. " Unfortunately, the site
isn't ready yet even though it appears they've been working on it since
1995. So far, they offer a single solution to all emergencies: Send
e-mail to archangel@angels.net.
</p><p>
There *is* a dog (<a class="ulink" href="http://dog.com/">dog.com</a>, a site devoted to dogs), a cat (the
Caterpillar tractor company, which assures us that their tractors are Y2K
safe. That's a relief), a giraffe (bad art by the self-dubbed "Digital
Giraffe"), a penguin (the paperback book publisher), and an ant (the
Antagonist Games Network, featuring "Maimed in Illinois", "Tomorrow Never
Dies", and the nightmarish "Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge"),
<a class="ulink" href="http://hen.com/">Hen.com</a> is a photo album of a minutes-old newborn baby. My favorites:
Baby lying in what appears to be a polyester jacket with a touch tone
phone disturbingly close to his head, and Baby striking a Nosferatu pose,
his perspective-distorted hands clawing at the camera. Mother and child
are doing fine. (Or they were--the baby was born in July, 1997, and the
site hasn't been updated since. But I'm sure his parent still love him.)
</p><p>
Whereas <a class="ulink" href="http://paranoia.com/">paranoia.com</a>
is merely suspicious, <a class="ulink" href="http://paranoid.com/">paranoid.com</a> is belligerent:
"We're not ready yet for you to view the Paranoia Family Tree. Why don't
you try again in 2000? Get it? 2000??" . No, actually, I don't get it.
But that's okay, I'll just back out and close the door quietly, alright?
Suspicious.com appears to be Linux propaganda. Belligerent.com is a snow
board shop. Attitude is one thing; whining is something else: There's no
whine, or bad-mood, or cranky.com.
</p><p>
On to philosophy. There's an <a class="ulink" href="http://erasmus.com">Erasmus.com</a>
(fittingly, a dutch insurance
company), an <a class="ulink" href="http://aristotle.com/">Aristotle.com</a> (unfittingly, an "internet in the grade
schools" vomitorium--don't get me started). There's also a
Schopenhauer.com, but it's owned by squatters. $500 and it's yours. $600
and we'll thrown in Hegel. And, of course, there is a Nietzche (and still
no god--he was right after all). Nietzsche.com features inappropriate
angels-in-infinity images, a couple of quotes, and the rather disturbing
tag line "The Countdown has Begun." Poor Friedrich-- first the Nazis, now
this.
</p><p>
Speaking of the auction block,
<a class="ulink" href="http://MaryPoppins.com/">MaryPoppins.com</a> is for sale, also for
$500. <a class="ulink" href="http://bouncingtigger.com/">BouncingTigger.com</a>
will set you back a grand. Reformulated as
Schopenhauer+Poppins=Tigger (or 19th century German pessimism + pseudo-
Edwardian magic realism = mindless euphoria), this seems about right. As
with most squatted domain names, the price for MaryPoppins (and
BouncingTigger) is negotiable. Not so TheGodfather.com. That'll be
$1500--no discussion--and you won't have any more spam troubles.
</p><p>
I was surprised that www.com.com is up for grabs, as is
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.dot.com/">www.dot.com</a>. But
www.wwwdotcom.com, www.www.com, and www.dotcom.com are taken. The last of
these is a domain name registry company that offers only "HIGH QUALITY"
domain names that were developed "IN-HOUSE" using "sophisticated software
analysis, web spider technology, and real- humans linguistics". But not,
evidently, real-humans grammar.
</p><p>
The_end.com gives you "the psychosis of tomorrow at yesterday's prices."
Sure. Theend.com is under construction. There is no heaven, but there
really is a hell.

I mean—have we arrived in <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> Heaven? In a previous column
"<a class="xref" href="Issue4-3.html#Gassee4-3" title="Organic Pace of Change">Organic Pace of Change</a>",
I lamented the glacial speed of the reaction between the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> standard and
the donors to PC clone organ bank. Ironically, Apple, the inventor of
FireWire, took the leadership position in delivering meaningful <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym>
hardware.
</p><p>
Some will say that Apple's impulse to run with <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> was taken in the
inimitable iCEO style. Others, such as yours truly, remember 1985, when
analysts where calling Apple names for using the nonstandard 3.5" floppy
instead of the proven 5.25" flavor favored by "serious" companies. Now it
looks as if the x86 industry is starting to use the connectors that have
been in the back of most PCs for more than 2 years. Fry's, my personal
testing ground for what really sells (as opposed to what merely generates
press releases) now has a nicely stocked <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> section, not just for
best-selling iMacs but also for "mere" PCs.
</p><p>
The Fry's test was reason enough for me to take the plunge. At home, I
have a dual processor, dual boot system that is the source of both mirth
and hand-wringing for Be engineers. With <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> support on both sides of the
dual boot, I could install <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> peripherals. These offer less trouble,
less competition for IRQs, CEO-proof connectivity in Windows 98, along
with the extra-added benefit of death to ISA, serial ports, and LPTs.
</p><p>
I started with what I thought was a simple project—connecting an HP
printer. Trying to be a good user, I connected everything with the power
off, started my system, and told System Commander to launch Windows 98.
Following the Plug&amp;Play model, Windows announced it had detected new
hardware and was installing the software for it. The HP installation
CD-ROM auto-ran and I proceeded to install the printer software. I
restarted the computer and... the printer was kind of detected but
wouldn't print. The diagnostic software said it could only establish
one-way communication.
</p><p>
No problem—just check cables and connections, test whether the printer
will print off-line. Yes, it does! So, uninstall the software and try
again—I must have gone through the steps too quickly the first time.
Second try—same symptoms. A third try doesn't cure them. When all else
fails, RTFM, read the fabulous manual. Hmmmm, I was a little too quick. I
wasn't supposed to connect everything before turning the power on—just
everything but the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> cable between the computer and the printer. Start
Windows and, when it's finished launching, plug in the cable. The rest of
the installation goes as expected and the printer works like a charm. I
should have read the instructions instead of assuming I knew how P&amp;P
worked.
</p><p>
Needless to say, I'm tempted to contrast this with the way we connect
devices via <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> or modify network settings without having to restart the
system. Emboldened by this experience, however, I decided to install
another <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> device, a CompactFlash reader, handy with a digital camera,
costs $79, comes with a cable. And, even if you don't have (yet) BeOS
drivers for it, the BeOS lets you grab those JPEG files in the Windows
partition—which makes for nice demos and even nicer every day
experience.
</p><p>
This time, I read the instructions carefully, and I'm baffled: the
leaflet says I'll have to go through the software install three times.
That's what I just did with the printer, but that was my mistake, sort
of. And I don't plug the cable before launching Windows, but after.
Windows detects the new hardware, asks for a pointer to a CD-ROM for
software, gets to the "Finish" button, closes the installer, and
immediately detects new hardware, declares it will install software for
it, gets to "Finish" again, the installer closes again, and the process
happens a third time.
</p><p>
The <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> Compact Flash reader works, the Comdex pictures are there, and
everything is fine. Sort of. Curiosity leads me to the Device Manager, to
check the results of the three install phases. Everything appears in
working order, no red flags or question marks. I have an E: drive now,
the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> devices look normal, but now the system tells me I have a SCSI
device as well. I swear under oath that I don't have SCSI hardware on my
system, Your Honor. It's bizarre—the promised simplicity isn't quite
there.
</p><p>
Still, let's consider the glass as more than half-full. With more <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym>
hardware available, this is an opportunity to demonstrate that we do
indeed offer a smoother, simpler user experience. And let's conclude on
an upbeat note, if you'll pardon the forward reference: a <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> guitar.
Virtual DSP, a Seattle company, offers one. On today's version, on-board
electronics do the pitch detection and the conversion to MIDI data passed
on to the computer via the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> connection. Nice. And possibly even nicer:
the low latency offered by the BeOS might allow most of the processing to
be done inside the system. As a result, the complexity of the on-board
electronics on the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> guitar could be dramatically reduced, cutting the
cost of down to tens instead of hundreds of dollars.
