Well, it's been eleven long months in the making, but the Preview Release
has finally been set free from the developmental cocoon. What started out
as a simple release whose only major goal was to replace the portions of
our system responsible for data storage turned into the most major
release we've ever done. And only five months late.
</p><p>
I know it's only software, and software is always late, but at Be we've
always been pretty timely with our software releases. And that's been
something to be proud of when you consider the amount of Apple OS team
engineering blood, admittedly diluted with infusions of SGI and NeXT
plasma, coursing through our veins.
</p><p>
But the uncertainty of a brand new file system, complete with all the
modern features, and the even-better integration of our famous database
technology left us five months late on what was to be about a five month
development cycle. Being off by 100% is impressive, but if I have to do
it I'd rather it be on a five month project than a four year one.
</p><p>
But enough talk about Apple.
</p><p>
What's next, after the Preview Release? This is the traditional time to
fix up some of those nasty little bugs which were elusive enough to
escape detection prior to CD duplication. Why they show up as the FedEx
truck is driving away I don't know, but there it is.
</p><p>
But it's DR10 that is really the focus of our attention these days. What
should we implement, what should we skip? What will be the most important
things we can do to improve the availability, stability, and usability of
the applications our developers are writing? More kits? More classes?
Fewer kits? More supported platforms? A PowerBook portable, or an Intel
desktop port? Both? Neither?
</p><p>
Believe me, the real list here at Be is quite daunting. The pressure for
the next release is now on, and we confront that list daily, brows
furrowed in deep contemplation. But with continued guidance from our keen
developers' insights, I'm sure that DR10 will be right on target. Let's
hope it's also right on time.

Or, in other words, it's NOT the technology.
</p><p>
To prove my point, all I need to do is point to DOS, circa 1982, which
many people, myself included, sneered at as being technically
uninteresting compared to the alternatives at the time such as Unix. I
remember the general wisdom then was that the superior Unix would
eventually replace DOS. Even Microsoft seemed to believe this, and for a
time, developed its Unix successor to DOS called Xenix (later abandoned).
</p><p>
Well, here we are today and Unix (with the exception of Linux) is gasping
for breath as it is beaten down by the likes of Windows NT, DOS's
grandchild. Yes, Virginia, there is still a DOS prompt in Windows NT and
it still has all the same primitive commands it did in 1982. Oops, I
caught myself sneering again!
</p><p>
So, something was terribly wrong with the analysis that many engineers
made of DOS in 1982. What was it? Some will say that the engineers didn't
consider the importance of the computer having the letters "IBM" on it. I
think there is some truth to that, but it doesn't explain the whole
story. Because soon thereafter, IBM lost its monopoly, yet consumers
continued to buy DOS, and continue to buy Windows today.
</p><p>
My opinion (and I fully expect to be flamed for saying this) is that
consumers care little for technical wizardry, and care deeply about
things like price and simplicity. And compared to DOS, Unix was (and
still is) an expensive and complicated beast.
</p><p>
The one exception, Linux, thrives only because it is free. The Macintosh,
though more expensive, was indeed simpler than a PC, and had a few years
of bounty because of it. But had the Mac been the same price as a PC, it
would be faring much better today. Apparently, the only technical
wizardry consumers cared for at the time was the ability to launch a
single application, and they really didn't feel like shelling out a lot
of money for any other features, however appealing those features may be
to engineers.
</p><p>
Today, consumers are a bit more savvy, and want more out of an operating
system than just a glorified program loader. Multitasking, GUIs and
Internet capabilities are all expected now. But these features are not
just checkbox items; people are really going to use them! So, they need
to be there without sacrificing simplicity. Windows, Mac OS and, I have
to admit, BeOS are all too complicated in this area. However, I think of
the three, BeOS comes closest to meeting the goal, because unlike the
others, it was designed to do all of them from the very start.
</p><p>
One of the examples of this is our file typing scheme in the BeOS, which
is based on MIME types, the Internet standard. We don't have to convert
downloaded files into some outdated proprietary file typing format as Mac
OS and Windows do. Because of this, Internet applications such as web
serving, web browsing and e-mail are simpler for the user to operate
under the BeOS. With just a little more work on our part, like making
network setup easier (PPP and LAN), we can make the BeOS the simplest OS
by far.
</p><p>
That brings me to price. PowerPC machines are still more expensive than
equivalently configured PCs, but clone makers like Power Computing have
been doing a great job of narrowing the difference. CHRP machines should
erode the gap even further. And a BeOS port to Intel would help to erase
the difference entirely. This is NOT an official product announcement,
just something to keep in mind, remembering that the BeOS is a very
portable operating system. But things are looking promising for PowerPC
prices coming down too.
</p><p>
Left out of this discussion has been applications. BeOS could use a few,
I'll admit. But remember that DOS didn't have any applications when it
started out either, but because of its price and simplicity (compared to
the alternatives at the time, such as CP/M and Unix), it attracted many.
The point is simply that perhaps if an operating system does what the
consumer wants, and offers it with simplicity and a low price, the
applications will follow. There are things Be or others can do to grease
the wheels, like provide a Mac or Windows emulator. But it may not be
necessary. After all, DOS couldn't run CP/M programs, nor could the Mac
run DOS programs.
</p><p>
My main goal in this article is simply to motivate you to write
applications for BeOS by seeing the market potential for it, which could
be huge. I'm not claiming that the BeOS will overtake Windows anytime
soon, but it is quite possible that it will carve out a nice niche for
itself as a simple and inexpensive application platform. An application
running on the BeOS, such as a web server, may be simpler and lower cost,
in total, than the same application running on another platform. This is
a great benefit to the consumer.
</p><p>
A secondary goal of this article is to deflect some criticism we get from
engineers because we are missing certain features that they feel are
important. If we put in every feature in that engineers want, we would
end up with an operating system like Solaris: complicated and expensive.
</p><p>
There is a lot of value in keeping things simple. I'm not saying we don't
welcome criticism; we certainly do. What I am saying is that we,
developers and Be alike, will all benefit by keeping the BeOS simple and
inexpensive, and criticism must be weighed against these two
all-important goals.
</p><p>
We are about to release the "BeOS Preview Release." This is the first
release which promises binary compatibility. That means the API and ABI
we will be shipping will remain in the BeOS for many releases to come,
allowing applications written for the BeOS Preview Release to run in
future releases. We will add more API in the future, but the current API
will not change. I think our API is very nice, but there will always be
engineers who may sneer at our current API (or almost any API, for that
matter). Sneer they may at their own risk. Remember, DOS's much
sneered-at API (API, what API?) was not a serious impediment to its
success.
</p><p>
For the sake of provoking thought, I have simplified things in this
article a bit. Yes, things are actually more complicated than I describe.
But we should never forget the customer's desires, however basic they may
seem to us. I am reminded of a poster my boss has in his office. On the
poster, you see a somewhat tall and fit man, with his arm around a
stouter, cigar-smoking man. The tall man states something like this,
"This is a customer. He has money to spend. I like him."

And finally...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;Application.h&gt;
#include &lt;Path.h&gt;
#include &lt;Entry.h&gt;

static <span class="type">void</span>
<code class="function">HomeDirectory</code>(<code class="classname">BPath</code> &amp;<code class="parameter">path</code>)
{
  <span class="type">app_info</span> <code class="varname">info</code>;
  <code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetAppInfo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">info</code>);
    <code class="classname">BEntry</code> <code class="varname">appentry</code>;
  <code class="varname">appentry</code>.<code class="methodname">SetTo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">info</code>.<code class="varname">ref</code>);
    <code class="varname">appentry</code>.<code class="methodname">GetPath</code>(&amp;<code class="parameter">path</code>);
  <code class="parameter">path</code>.<code class="methodname">GetParent</code>(&amp;<code class="parameter">path</code>);
}
</pre><p>
<code class="classname">BEntry</code> is a wonderful thing. It gives you a C++ representation of an
<span class="type">entry_ref</span>. <code class="classname">BPath</code> is also a wonderful
thing. A <code class="classname">BPath</code> will easily represent
your <code class="classname">BEntry</code> and allow you to perform some very useful operations. In this
particular case, we can use the <code class="classname">BPath</code> object to get the parent of the
application file. In this case the parent is the directory in which the
application is actually living, meaning the HomeDirectory. Passing in a
<code class="classname">BPath</code> object is better than a <span class="type">char*</span> with a length simply because memory
allocation is taken care of for you with less potential for mistake.
Among the other interesting things you can do with a
<code class="classname">BPath</code> are <code class="methodname">Flatten()</code>
and <code class="methodname">Append()</code>. Flattening allows you to store a path in a archive.
<code class="methodname">Append()</code>
allows you to add onto a path. This is often the case when you're looking
for files that are located relative to your launch directory.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BPath</code> <code class="varname">path</code>;
<code class="function">HomeDirectory</code>(<code class="varname">path</code>);
<code class="varname">path</code>.<code class="methodname">Append</code>("goodies");
</pre><p>
Now you can use the path to create a <code class="classname">BDirectory</code> object to find files, or
whatnot.
</p><p>
Another question that seems to be coming up a lot is, "How can I set type
and creator for my files?" Well, in the new MIME world, you don't use
type/creator like in DR8. Instead you will set a MIME type on a file.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BFile</code> <code class="varname">file</code>;
<code class="varname">file</code>.<code class="methodname">SetTo</code>(<code class="varname">aPath</code>.<code class="methodname">Path</code>(), <code class="constant">O_RDWR</code>);

<code class="classname">BNodeInfo</code> <code class="varname">node</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">file</code>);
<code class="varname">node</code>.<code class="methodname">SetType</code>("text/plain");
</pre><p>
The <code class="classname">BNodeInfo</code> object is your connection to getting and setting various
pieces of meta data on a node. <code class="classname">BFile</code>s
are nodes, and so are <code class="classname">BDirectorie</code>s.
Among the interesting things you can get/set on a <code class="classname">BNode</code> are the MIME
type, its icon, and the preferred application. This is particularly handy
if your application is one that generates files and you want your
application to be the one that launches those freshly created files. So,
<code class="classname">BNodeInfo</code> is the place to go for all your meta data needs.
</p><p>
There you have it. The new file system is not only 64-bit clean, snappy,
and robust, but it's darned useful to boot and pretty darned easy to
harness those added features. The attributes are there, and largely
hidden. This NodeInfo class makes some of the more commonly used
attributes more readily available to your application.
</p><p>
A couple of weeks ago my BeBox had what I thought was a sure melt down. I
did figure out that the disk drive was touching the power regulator on
the motherboard. This is about the hottest piece of metal you can touch
on your motherboard. The disk drive actually came out OK. The outer
plastic casing was fried, but not to the point of causing any real
damage. I turned it on, and I've been happily using it ever since.
Although now it make some strange rattling sounds, so I think it's time
to retire it anyway.
</p><p>
The 4th of July has come and gone. On that day, I stood at attention in
front of the American flag and smartly saluted in recognition of the
freedoms that I enjoy...to program the BeOS in the face of tyranny of the
desktop and against all odds of the oppressors. I didn't actually stand
in front of the flag, but I did think about it.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee2-27"></a>The Rebirth of the Set-Top Box</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
About 1992, every hardware company was either doing a set-top box, or
claiming to be designing one. Apparently, these efforts didn't go
anywhere. With hindsight, the reason is obvious: Too much computing power
for too little money. The tasks expected from a new generation "digital"
box required more computing power than a mid-range PC could offer at the
time: Decompressing video, creating some kind of user-interface for
navigating the service, security services and, in extreme cases, a loop
back to the server for "interactive" applications. Even with some
absorption of the cost by one or more participants in the food chain, the
financial burden was too much.
</p><p>
I used the word "apparently" above. In one of the reassuring mysteries of
our industry, one of these episodes that remind us of the difference
between PowerPoint and reality, that set-top box false start gave us
Java, nee Oak, a programming language originally designed for safely
distributing small executables over cable and satellite networks.
</p><p>
Now, with the impending but still undefined arrival of digital TV, the
set-top box is coming back. Even with three or four cycles of Moore's
Law, broadcasters and cable operators are still complaining about the
cost of the device. One friend of mine argues this is the reason why
Microsoft is making investments in cable (COMSAT) and is rumored to be
eyeing, forgive the pun, CBS. In other words, if links in the food chain
are too tentative, Microsoft will buy them and make sure the whole chain
is completed, ensuring the availability of an infrastructure "sorely"
missing today. Such an infrastructure is needed to develop really juicy
commerce and entertainment applications.
</p><p>
I don't know, yet, whether my friend is fantasizing or merely
prophesizing, but it's an interesting speculation. Bill Gates' impatience
with the clumsy, slow development of a better infrastructure is no
speculation; it is part of the public record. If Microsoft used its
considerable resources, financial and otherwise, to such an end, I
believe the benefits to all of us would outweigh the danger of Microsoft
dominating yet another industry. Please don't call me a Microsoft
apologist, I'd just like to see new markets we've been hoping for finally
arrive.
</p><p>
Now, it's not that easy. Microsoft's fiat, powerful as it is, isn't a
guarantee of success. Many successful companies, from IBM to Sony, from
Matsushita to AT&amp;T, from Xerox to Digital Equipment, have seen their
famed expertise vanish as they ventured into unfamiliar territories.
Microsoft has shown a remarkable ability to change its mind and refocus
itself, ask Netscape and CompuServe. But their ventures into the content
space with MSN and MSNBC are, at this time, less than convincing.
Interesting times ahead, as always.

What's the best way to do a "safe save" (in which you're guaranteed to
have a copy of a given file at all times, even if the machine crashes
while you're writing the file)? Suggestions were offered, as were
objections to the particulars, such as where you should safe-save a
file, when you should sync, and so on.
</p><p>
Some folks would like to safe-save as part of the file system itself.
It would be appreciated if the file system (or BFile) were to ensure
that certain files always existed—perhaps by writing new data to a
temp file and then moving the file to the "real" location. Others think
that deciding when, where, and how to save can *only* be decided by an
application. The file system could guess, but at the cost of either
performance or integrity.
</p><p>
Speaking of synching—the Storage Kit doesn't provide a Sync()
function, nor can you convert a Kit object (BEntry or BNode) into a
file descriptor that you can pass to fsync(). This lack was lamented.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id573177"></a>Subject: Modality</h4></div></div></div><p>
Should panels (open file, save file, print, etc.) ever be modal?
</p><p>
It was argued that in a multi-threaded OS, modality isn't necessary,
and can be obnoxious.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id573195"></a>Subject: C++ question and handling errors</h4></div></div></div><p>
Is it possible to delete "this" inside a constructor? Most folks agree:
Don't delete "this"; instead, either set a status variable (that must
then be checked by the caller), or throw an exception.
</p><p>
More elegantly, if your object needs to be initialized to be used, and
if the init can fail, put the init code in some other function. In
other words, you should never write a constructor that can fail.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id573217"></a>Subject: Persistent driver data</h4></div></div></div><p>
Should a device driver be allowed to launch an application (to ask the
user for settings, etc.). The BeOS says no. Some folks think this is
too restrictive—they feel that a driver should be allowed to
initialize itself; relying on a server is clunky and possibly unsafe
(since there's no guarantee that the server will load before the
driver.)
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id573234"></a>Subject: Dumb sound question</h4></div></div></div><p>
Is it possible to (easily) play a sound from a buffer rather than from
a file? Not as easily as <code class="function">play_sound()</code>, but creating an audio subscriber
and implementing its stream function is fairly easy, as a few folks
pointed out. Still, it would be appreciated if the Media Kit were to
accept pointers to sound data (and a pointer to a header), and simply
do the right thing.
</p><p>
Also, what's the best way to mix your data into the sound output
stream? Simple addition could cause overflow. But how often will peaks
collide? Some folks think that if you mix disparate signals (from
different apps, for example) the natural disparity will average to
in-range values. So you may not need to "divide by the number of
subscribers". However, you *do* have to clip overflow (to the max/min
