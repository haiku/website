The first time I realized that an Apple II was able to turn a pixel on or
off, I was hooked. At that time, programming was pretty easy—no big
manual to read, no Ph.D. was required, just energy and imagination. Then
came the "modern" machines. Suddenly, I had to read and understand in great
detail massive amounts of documentation. "Let's write a small program" was
a thing of the past. Well, I think the fun is back. After doing my regular
system work at Be (if such a thing exists!), I often sit down and write a
small application.
</p><p>
Why is the BeBox fun to program? I guess the main reason is that most of
the operating system design and application framework was done by people
with experience in writing real programs. As a result, common things are
easy to implement and the programming model is CLEAR. You don't need to
know hundreds of details to get simple things working. The second reason is
speed. We all want fast machines, so the BeBox was designed with
performance in mind—performance at both the user and operating system
levels.
</p><p>
Why is the BeBox fast? Well, first because it uses a large number of
threads at the system level. For instance, a single window always has two
threads associated with it: One on the client side, which is used when
drawing in the window, and one on the application server side, which is
used to execute the client's requests. This simple idea takes advantage of
the dual-CPU architecture without the application programmer having to know
about it. In a certain sense, for the duration of a graphic operation, one
of the CPUs turns into a super graphics coprocessor. In the same way, when
you do a lot of small writes to a file, the actual writing to the file is
performed by another thread. In this case, the second CPU becomes a
dedicated I/O processor. Finally, we always look at the machine as a whole.
Since we can control all aspects of the software, we can optimize the
subtle interaction of many different components.
</p><p>
Why did I come to work for a company like Be? Well, I couldn't resist the
opportunity to design and build a machine for MYSELF. This is very much the
state of mind I had when we started: What would be MY dream machine? There
is, of course, room for a lot of improvement in the system, but the basic
concepts are now in place.
</p><p>
Now I can learn from your experience and needs to create YOUR dream
machine, as well as mine. After five years of pain, I have a machine shaped
by my desires; I hope that you like it and that you come to agree that
programming is fun again.

"As nerds, it's always fun to mess with the coolest hardware,
especially when it's from a company that's driven by technical people"
says James Coliz, when asked why his small Illusions Gaming Co. is
interested in developing software for the BeBox.
</p><p>
This 25-person development company in Sausalito, California, specializes in
video games for Sega Genesis and the recently released Sony PlayStation,
the advanced video game system that captured everyone's attention at the
last Consumer Electronics Show. Illusions is also pouring resources into
the new Sega Saturn CD-ROM-based video game system.
</p><p>
Neither PlayStation nor Saturn have reached huge installed bases. But
Illusions can't resist the opportunity to work with the most advanced
hardware. They were immediately intrigued by the BeBox.
</p><p>
"We have to deal with a lot of the things they talk about; MIDI, sound
mixing, and network communications" Coliz says. "The idea is to
see how far we can push it. We're doing it because it'll be fun."
</p><p>
In addition, Illusions is intrigued by the possibility of developing hot,
3D, networked games for the BeBox, an opportunity which isn't available on
the soloist-oriented Sega and Sony systems.
</p><p>
It's also a good business opportunity, Coliz says. If he'd had to work with
the traditional game distribution model and royalties for the BeBox, Coliz
might have passed. But he says Be's promise of an electronic software
distribution system opens the possibility of a good return with a minimal
investment in distribution.
</p><p>
Coliz and his partner, Darren Barlett, started Illusions Gaming four years
ago with their own money. The company reached $1 million in sales last
year, mostly from royalties on its Sega Genesis games. For the most part,
Illusions is a creative services and engineering company. It employs 13
artists, designers, and animators plus six full-time programmers. It was
also credited with some animation work in Walt Disney's The Lion King.
</p><p>
"We have all these resources and it'll be great to take one more
platform and get something fun out of it," Coliz says. "That's
the whole point."

I'm often asked if I can describe the "killer app" for the BeBox.
This raises enough questions for a series of columns. But let me start with
the moniker itself and the notion of "guide geeks." I much prefer
the phrase "tractor application" to "killer app." The
kinetics in the metaphor are more appealing. Each one of the existing
platforms enjoys one or more applications that really pulled it into the
market. We'll review them in a moment. That's where the guide geeks come
in.
</p><p>
Only the leading-edge, sometimes called bleeding-edge, users and
programmers have the skills and the vision to explore the possibilities of
what we've built and to unfold the contents of its genes.
</p><p>
Based on my reading of the history of our industry, I believe the people
involved in building the platform, because of their close involvement,
develop myopia and can't see the tractor apps in the distance.
</p><p>
For instance, when they designed the Apple II, the two Steves had no idea
that Bob Frankston and Dan Bricklin were going to invent VisiCalc, the big
time tractor. When he set out to design the original IBM PC, Don Estridge
had no idea that a transcendental meditation teacher named Mitch Kapor
would create Lotus 1-2-3, at one time the most successful application on
the platform. Back to Apple, when Steve Jobs and Jef Raskin started
building what became the Macintosh, they had no idea Messrs. Kitamura,
Warnock, and Brainerd (at Canon, Adobe, and Aldus) would create desktop
publishing, still a leadership application for the Mac. And the creators of
the Amiga didn't have the Video Toaster in mind when they started either.
You see my point. Rather than betting that we're less myopic than our noble
and worthy elders, let's accept that we're shortsighted—and do
something to compensate for it. Let's use the more technically inclined and
aggressive users as guide geeks towards the next innovative applications,
the next genre. Today, if I ask a mainstream user, s/he will want more,
smaller, faster, cheaper. And there are a wealth of interesting
developments taking place along those lines—more disk space, more
processor speed, ISDN, and so on. (I'd like less expensive memory, but for
some reason, this seems to be the lone exception.) But this is all
derivative of what's happening today. We need to find the discontinuities
where our new baby can flourish.
</p><p>
I'm also often told that everything that can be done has been done
already—nothing really new can happen anymore. I've heard this many
times since I introduced a distant ancestor of today's PCs, the HP 9100A,
in France in 1968. Since then, the industry hasn't been boring. How many
people knew about the Internet and the web three years ago? No one in the
mainstream—and many people in geekdom.
