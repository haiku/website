Try as we might to separate and hide our implementation of the BeOS,
certain dependencies are created the moment a developer compiles and
links against our dynamically loaded libraries. These dependencies
include:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The size of objects (i.e. structs or classes)
</p></li><li><p>
The offsets to "visible" (public or protected) data
</p></li><li><p>
The existence and size of the vtable
</p></li><li><p>
The offsets to the virtual functions in the vtable
</p></li></ul><p>
When your app is compiled and linked, it records all these statistics. If
any of these things changes in the library, the compiled app will no
longer run. This is the "Fragile Base Class" problem.
</p><p>
With the almost-in-your-hands Preview Release, we're putting a stake in
the ground: The Preview Release will be forward- compatible with
subsequent releases of the BeOS. How far into the future will this
compatibility last? Frankly, we don't know—we'll run it out as far as
we can, but if we hit a brick wall we'll reassess our position.
</p><p>
To archive the goal of forward-compatibility, we had to take certain
steps. If you're designing your own library, and if you want to be able
re-release your library without breaking your client's code, you may want
to follow similar steps.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id568962"></a>The Bright Side</h3></div></div></div><p>
Before we look at our FBC solution, let's look at what CAN change without
breaking compatibility:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Non-virtual functions. A class can adopt as many new non-virtuals as
it wants. Old code won't be able to take advantage of the new
functions, of course, but you won't break anything.
</p></li><li><p>
New classes. New classes are permitted as long as they don't change
the inheritance hierarchy of the existing classes.
</p></li><li><p>
Implementation. The way that existing functions are implemented is
allowed to change. Re-implementing old functions is obviously not
something to be done lightly, but it's not going to tickle the FBC
problem.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id569001"></a>The Dark Side</h3></div></div></div><p>
Here are the matters that affect the FBC problem, and our solution for
each:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The Size of Objects Cannot Change
</p><p>
The "size of an object" means the cumulative size of its data members. If
more data members are added, the class will break compatibility. In the
Preview Release, we've reserved an "appropriate" amount of data in each
class:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="varname">_reserved</code>[X];
</pre><p>
Where "X" is determined on a class-by-class basis. If we anticipate that
the class won't ever change (<code class="classname">BRect</code>, for example), then we didn't add any
padding. If the object is small but it might grow, then we added a little
—maybe 25-50% of the current size. For example, the <code class="classname">BMessenger</code> object
has 13 bytes of real data; we've padded it with 7 extra bytes. Large
classes get even more.
</p><p>
So what happens three months from now when the "right amount" ends up
being too little? The final "_reserved" value can be used to point to
another structure that accommodates the new data (taking into account
that a pointer and a <span class="type">int32</span> might not be the same size).
</p></li><li><p>
Offsets of Publicly Visible Data Members Cannot Change
</p><p>
When thinking about the FBC problem realize that the "protected" C++
keyword really means "public." Anything that is "protected" is publicly
visible. Any "public" or "protected" data members are fixed in stone:
Their offsets and sizes can never change.
</p><p>
There isn't a "solution" to this because it really isn't a problem; it's
just something you must be aware of if you're making your own library.
</p></li><li><p>
Be Wary of <code class="code">inline</code> Functions
</p><p>
If an <code class="code">inline</code> function exposes the size/offset of a private data member
then that private member is actually public: Its size and offset can
never change. We've removed all such inlines from the kits. Unless
there's some overriding performance issue I'd recommend you do the same
in your libraries. Remember: The only safe inlines are those that only
reference public members (data or functions) or non-virtual private
member functions.
</p></li><li><p>
VTable Now for the Future
</p><p>
If a class/struct is *ever* going to have a vtable it better have one
now. Adding that first virtual function changes the size of the class,
and possibly the offsets of every single data member.
</p><p>
Add a dummy virtual (or a few) now or forever hold your peace. If a class
doesn't need virtual functions, then you don't need to do anything.
</p><p>
Even if a class already has virtual functions, you may want to add more
—do it now or never. In the Be kits, most classes have additional
reserved virtual functions; look at the beginning of any private section
in a Be header file and you'll see them:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">BWhatAPain</code> {
  public:
      ...
  private:
      virtual <span class="type">void</span>  <code class="function">_ReservedWhatAPain1</code>();
      virtual <span class="type">void</span>  <code class="function">_ReservedWhatAPain2</code>();
      virtual <span class="type">void</span>  <code class="function">_ReservedWhatAPain3</code>();
      ...
};
</pre></li><li><p>
The Ugly Safety Net
</p><p>
For some classes, it's difficult to estimate the correct number of extra
virtuals. Too many is okay, but too few can be bad.
</p><p>
To solve this problem, an additional "ioctl"-like virtual function can be
added to the class hierarchy for unlimited (but ugly) extensibility.
"Perform" is the name of choice for this type of function. As an example,
look in the <code class="classname">BArchivable</code> class:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">BArchivable</code> {
  public:
      ...
      virtual <span class="type">status_t</span>    <code class="methodname">Perform</code>(<span class="type">uint32</span> <code class="parameter">d</code>, <span class="type">void *</span><code class="parameter">arg</code>);
};
</pre><p>
If the function is needed, we can define "selector codes" and use the
Perform function like so:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">ptr</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Perform</code>(<code class="constant">B_SOME_ACTION</code>, <code class="varname">data</code>);
</pre><p>
It's not pretty, but it gives us room if a class runs out of dummy
virtuals.
</p></li><li><p>
Public Virtual Function Order Cannot Change
</p><p>
The order that public virtual functions appear in the header file is set
in concrete. The Metrowerks compiler orders vtable entries based on the
order in which they appear. Virtual function order can not be shuffled
later on. (We're lucky that entries aren't alphabetized! Think about it.)
</p><p>
private virtuals, on the other hand, *can* be reordered. But that's only
because in the kits we don't define any private virtuals that can be (or
should be) overridden.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id569280"></a>A Dilemma</h3></div></div></div><p>
Looking at the last two items leads to an unfortunate problem. Let's say
that in a subsequent BeOS release, we want to use one of the dummy
virtuals. We can't simply move it to another part of the header file --
vtable order is set in stone. But a function CAN be moved from private to
public. As we (at Be) need a dummy virtual, we'll simply "peel" the
topmost private function up into the public section.
</p><p>
For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">BWhatAPain</code> {
  public:
      ...
      virtual <span class="type">int32</span>  <code class="methodname">NewDR10Function</code>(... arglist ...);
  private:
      virtual <span class="type">void</span>  <code class="methodname">_ReservedWhatAPain2</code>();
      virtual <span class="type">void</span>  <code class="methodname">_ReservedWhatAPain3</code>();
      ...
};
</pre><p>
This is why we chose to stick the dummy virtuals at the top of the
private section.
</p><p>
But what if the class has a protected section that contains virtual
functions? Remember, you can't reorder your virtuals, but you can
"interleave" sections. It's not pretty...
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">BAreWeHavingFunYet</code> {
  public:
      ...
  protected:
      ...
      virtual <span class="type">int32</span>  <code class="methodname">SomeOldProtectedVirtual</code>();

  public:
      virtual <span class="type">int32</span>  <code class="methodname">NewDR10Function</code>(... arglist ...);

  private:
      virtual <span class="type">void</span>  <code class="methodname">_ReservedAreWeHavingFunYet2</code>();
      virtual <span class="type">void</span>  <code class="methodname">_ReservedAreWeHavingFunYet3</code>();
      ...
};
</pre><p>
...but it works.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id569394"></a>Another Dilemma</h3></div></div></div><p>
There's another subtle issue dealing with overriding a virtual function.
I'll explain the problem in a moment, but first the solution: If a class
might ever need to override an inherited virtual function it's much
better and simpler to override that function *now*.
</p><p>
Here's the problem. Let's say a kit declares a couple of classes thus:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
class <code class="classname">A</code> {
  public:
      virtual <code class="methodname">X</code>();
};

class <code class="classname">B</code> : public <code class="classname">A</code>
  { ... };  <span class="comment">// i.e. B *doesn't* override A::X()</span>
</pre><p>
Now a developer creates their own class (<code class="classname">C</code>) that
inherits from <code class="classname">B</code>, and
overrides the <code class="methodname">X()</code> function as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">C</code>::<code class="methodname">X</code>() {
  ...
     inherited::<code class="methodname">X</code>(); <span class="comment">// OUCH! statically resolved</span>
                        call to A::X()
  ...
}
</pre><p>
The call to inherited isn't <code class="code">virtual</code>. It's a statically resolved call to
the "closest" override; in this case, it resolves to <code class="methodname">A::X()</code>. That's okay
as far as it goes—but what if, in a subsequent release, class <code class="classname">B</code> *does*
override <code class="methodname">X()</code>? The developer's code will *still* resolve
<code class="methodname">inherited::X()</code> as
<code class="methodname">A::X()</code>—in other words, the developer will skip right over
<code class="methodname">B::X()</code>.
</p><p>
The solution that covers all cases is to fully override all inherited
virtuals (where the implementation simply calls inherited). But that's
overkill; it could impact performance and would complicate our API. So we
applied some discretion in the kits; some classes override some
functions, others don't.
</p><p>
But let's say it's getting close to DR10, and we now realize that a
couple of our do-we-need-to-override guesses were wrong. There's a
solution, but it's complex, *very* ugly, and too much trouble to explain
here.

Never put an object that contains a vtable into shared memory. The
vtable contains addresses that are only valid for a particular address
space.
</p></li><li><p>
You can't override the new/delete operators after the fact. It's now
or never.
</p></li></ul><p>
That's all there is to it!

Requiem for a BeBox
</p><p>
A moment of silence please for my recently departed BeBox...
</p><p>
I take my BeBox "portable" home almost every night because I simply can't
get enough. If you are one of the programmers such as myself who has had
the privilege of programming on one of these machines, you have come to
appreciate a fun and enjoyable experience. Just the thought of dual
processors makes you feel like you have something no one else does and
are therefore on the cutting edge.
</p><p>
I have another BeBox at home, but my wife is now a BeBox programmer as
well, so I can't simply use that machine. So I cart the one from my desk
back and forth. The weight isn't too much because I know the reward on
the other end will be a few more hours of programming this beautiful OS.
</p><p>
Last night I carted my machine home as usual. In my machine I have two
hard disks, each with a couple of partitions, a FireWire card, a
Hauppauge board, a Matrox Millennium board, and a Jaz drive, and the
usual chunk of memory.
</p><p>
After Yasmin was well asleep, I thought I'd sit down for a little evening
news. I hooked up the box in the office, and went to sit on the couch. A
few minutes later I was thinking to myself, "my that grass fire smells
strange." There was a fire in the local hills earlier in the day, so I
thought nothing of it. Then a couple minutes later I thought, wait a
minute, I live in Silicon Valley and that smells strangely like silicon
frying!! I dashed into the room. There were no visuals of smoke, but
something was definitely frying. The LEDs were pegged so I reached for
the switch. Upon inspection, I found that the disk drive that I had
unsecured was pressing against a part of the motherboard that it
shouldn't have been touching. Result, fried disk or motherboard. I'm
afraid to turn it on to check.
</p><p>
Your mind races in such situations. I wasn't too bent out of shape
though. I have that Jaz drive for a reason, and I do use it. The only
thing lost was the latest modifications to the /dev/wacom driver. I can
reproduce that and be back in business. The one thing I really lament is
that this was an excellent opportunity to use:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="function">is_computer_on_fire</code>()
</pre><p>
and I missed it.
</p><p>
DARN, DARN, DARN, DARN!!!
</p><p>
So, it's been asked enough times, what's the difference between Datatypes
and Rraster codecs. And I've answered enough times, "Use Datatypes."
Rraster exists by necessity. Datatypes didn't go out with the Advanced
Access release, and we wanted to have an image viewer. The codecs were
written quite a few months ago. Rraster codecs only do reading, Datatypes
are for reading and writing. Datatypes will also translate between any
format, Rraster will only do images. Datatypes is a nice solid framework
for the inclusion of data in any format including movies, sound, still
images, text, and whatever else can be thought up in the future.
</p><p>
The Datatypes library will be included in the upcoming Preview Release.
It is based on the 1.52 release from Jon Watte. It is not quite as
Be-ified as it could be, that will be a future exercise, but it's there
and you can create those codecs as freely as you like. This library has
found great usefulness in many apps to date. We are not quite giving it
our full support, but merely including it as a matter of convenience. You
should expect that in the future it will move more into the Be fold and
be a more integrated part of the system. The primary benefit for the
future might be that we start to utilize it, or similar functionality
within our own applications such as Rraster.
</p><p>
One benefit I did see about the recent histrionics on this topic is that
a couple more Datatypes aware applications have been written, once again
proving the worth and ease of this framework. That can't be bad.
</p><p>
A side discussion of this whole Datatypes thing has been this question:
How do I get my application's "launch" directory. Well, the
<code class="classname">BApplication</code>
object doesn't provide a method directly, but you can do this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="function">HomeDirectory</code>(<span class="type">char *</span><code class="parameter">dir</code>, <span class="type">constint</span> <code class="parameter">buffLen</code>)
{
  <span class="type">app_info</span> <code class="varname">info</code>;
  <code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetAppInfo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">info</code>);

  <code class="classname">BEntry</code> <code class="varname">appentry</code>;
  <code class="varname">appentry</code>.<code class="methodname">SetTo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">info</code>.<code class="varname">ref</code>);

  <code class="classname">BPath</code> <code class="varname">path</code>;
  <code class="varname">appentry</code>.<code class="methodname">GetPath</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">path</code>);
  <code class="function">strncpy</code>(<code class="parameter">dir</code>, <code class="varname">path</code>.<code class="methodname">Path</code>(),<code class="parameter">buffLen</code>);
  <code class="parameter">dir</code>[<code class="parameter">buffLen</code>] = '\0';

  return <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>;
};
</pre><p>
Or variations on the theme to return a <code class="classname">BDirectory</code> object instead. From
there you can locate resources that might be located within your launch
directory. Of course if you're writing a POSIX application, you'll
probably just use the <code class="function">getcwd()</code> function, or argv[0].
</p><p>
Have you ever in your career participated in the final days of a major
software release, prepared for developer conferences on two continents,
written interesting sample code and commentary for one of those
conferences, taken care of your fire ball two year old because her nanny
is on vacation, all within the space of a couple of weeks? Thank goodness
it's all for the BeOS. Just one more compile ought to do it!

CompuServe occupies a special place in my affections.
</p><p>
Once upon a time they were the model on-line service, reliable, available
everywhere, full of "good stuff." Sixteen years ago, when we started
Apple France, we suffered from CompuServe envy. It hadn't absorbed The
Source yet, a wonderful name, and wasn't easily accessible overseas. To
make the Apple II more attractive, we decided it needed its own, local,
on-line service. So, with the help of The American College in Paris, we
paid homage to CompuServe and started Calvados, a word play on apple
jack. Calvados went through several transformations and is now
essentially a French ISP.
</p><p>
The idea endured. In the early versions of our business plans, as
recounted in a previous newsletter, we intended to build a BBS in order
to wire together the Be community, developers, customers and ourselves.
The Web mercifully freed us—and our shareholders—from having to
build and debug such an infrastructure.
</p><p>
There are more ties to CompuServe. Before starting Be, as I was leaving
Apple, I looked at several business opportunities; one of them was buying
CompuServe and modernizing it. At the time, I was of the opinion there
was much "unexpressed" value in CompuServe and I thought of ways to make
it more visible to customers and, as a result, to shareholders.
Negotiations didn't even start when we heard H&amp;R Block, the owners,
thought the business was worth about $900 Million on the basis of $125
million revenue, while NYC investment bankers felt they could justify
$400 million.
</p><p>
Later, around 1992-1993, we tried to build a CompuServe client into the
BeOS. We still wanted to wire the Be-ers together and we felt we could do
a nice job of it by neatly integrating CompuServe's HMI (Host Micro
Interface) protocol into our product, thus creating a better user
experience.
</p><p>
CompuServe was reluctant to work with us; the stated reason revolved
around the support headaches our HMI implementation would create. In one
guise or another, the old ideas are alive and well as we debug the
Preview Release version of our NetPositive browser.
</p><p>
I re-signed with CompuServe as I prepared for a trip to several European
locations. I had canceled my subscription a while ago, preferring an
Internet account with a local ISP. This time, I wanted the convenience
and reliability of access to e-mail on the road without spending a
fortune in international calls. CompuServe came to mind with local access
in many European locations.
</p><p>
The sign-up was painless and I thought I had secured an easy solution to
my problem. In a way, I had, but there were glitches reminding me of the
differences between old style on-line services and Internet ways. First,
I received several urgent messages advising me of unspecified problems
with my sign-up data and requesting resubmission "using the enclosed
form."
</p><p>
The form refused to be filled out. Fearing cut-off, I e-mailed fully
restated data, including the billing address I thought was the source of
the problem. When I logged in from Paris, I found my reply to customer
service had been rejected because their mailbox was full. No complaints
yet, I'm still connected as I write this.

The worse news is the custom browser used as the standard CompuServe 3.0
client. The mail part can't reliably open attached files and is much less
flexible than either Eudora or the mail function of Microsoft's or
Netscape's browsers. The better news is you can forget the client
altogether, dial up CompuServe and use a "standard" browser and e-mail
package.

From that perspective the site is just another site, nice but
unremarkable. And, with a local call, I can connect to my Silicon Valley
ISP, retrieve mail and browse my favorite Web pages—which is what I
wanted most. I should be happy.

Yet, I feel a little sad as I see CompuServe struggle with its conversion
to the Internet. Its contents and user interface remind me of the good
old days, but no longer feel competitive. And making money as an ISP,
even an international one, looks like a hard road back to financial
health. Company cultures are mysterious, how they're born, how they
evolve, how they can or can't be changed once they've become a liability.
Something to fear, something to admire.
