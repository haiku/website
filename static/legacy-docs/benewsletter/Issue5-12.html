If you do a Google search for "George Hoffman," the whole first page of
hits is for some "Captain George Hoffman" from New Jersey who not only is
no relation to me but is also dead. If you just search for "Hoffman," I'm
not even in the first hundred hits (I didn't look any farther). If you
search for "geh," there are a bunch of hits for the George Eastman House,
followed by a lot of stuff that must be total garbage because *it* isn't
even in *Engish*.
</p><p>
In fact, the only Google search I know of for me in which I actually
appear on the first page of hits is for "George Earle Hoffman" (my full,
unfortunate name). This turns up two references to two separately
maintained lists of GNUStep volunteers. I'm listed as working on a
GNUStep test suite, which must be the result of an e-mail question I sent
to the project maintainer in 1994. Let this be a warning to you all: Open
Source is catching. It could happen to you!
</p><p>
What's my point? I recently decided that there simply isn't enough with
my name on it. In the grand scheme of things, I've done nothing with my
life. My existence is meaningless. Compared to the likes of Stephen
Hawking, Ani DiFranco, or Regis Philbin, I am as an ant to the mighty
cockroach. Now, this is a realization that everyone (except maybe The
Regis) comes to at one point or another in their lives. Some people deal
with it gracefully, and some people grab automatic weapons and head for
the nearest clock tower.
</p><p>
How did I deal with this personal crisis? Well, I'd like to say that I
rose to the challenge and adopted a Cause: steadfastly dedicated my life
to preserving the rain forests, or feeding starving children, or freeing
Kevin Mitnick, or organizing sit-ins or walk-outs or walkathons, or
saving baby seals, or clubbing baby seals, or being outraged at people
who have genitals or who use them in a certain way, or one of those other
things that somehow always results in the blocking off of perfectly good
roads which happen to lead where I want to go. But what I actually did
was move to Millbrae, buy a red sports car, and start dating a girl who
is far too young for me.
</p><p>
I could have sworn there was a point to all that. Oh, yes! I also wrote
some code.
</p><p>
You see, you may think that what Be engineers are good at is writing an
operating system. This is an imprecise statement. You may think that we
are good at doing things the "right" way. This, while arguably true, is
also not quite right. What Be engineers are best at is taking some
problem which is laughably easy to solve and making it complicated enough
to interest us. It's not enough, for example, for us to be able to play a
movie. We have to be able to play 30 of them, in parallel, on eight CPUs,
while surfing the Web and playing Quake II. (You may have heard this
referred to in our marketing literature as "sexy"... we engineers know
that's just marketing speak for "butt-ass complicated.") Who buys an
eight-processor machine and then watches 30 movies on it all at the same
time? Beats me. They told us they could sell it, so we made it.
</p><p>
You may have heard that recently they told us they can sell it even
better if it's smaller and can browse the Web really, *really* well. Web
browsers are complicated beasts, but not nearly complicated enough for
us. Our browser has to be totally ripped. So a number of us have been
working on the Next Generation BeOS Browser, based on the latest Opera
Browser technology, and oh man, it doesn't get much more "sexy" than this.
</p><p>
One thing the astute engineer will notice about the Web is that it is
fairly large. There is thus a lot of data that can be attained by
examining it. Furthermore, this data comes in small packets: things like
GIF images, HTML pages, style sheets, Flash movies, etc. For the
traditional monolithic browser, this kind of data is not too hard to
manage, but for a highly multithreaded browser like the one we're
creating, there arises a question of locking granularity. If I'm
accessing a given resource, say, a GIF image, in one thread of a
multithreaded application, how do I control access to that resource? I
need a way to guarantee that there will be no destructive interference
between two threads that desire access to a resource.
</p><p>
I could use semaphores, of course. Let's say I decide to give each
resource a semaphore, and use it to mutex access to the resource. There
are two problems with this approach: one, if access to the resource
happens often, I may take a sizable performance hit, because I need to
enter the kernel twice for every pass through the critical section.
Second, I use up a semaphore, a kernel object, for each and every
resource. Now, I could switch to the benaphore, a locking primitive
invented by our own Benoit Schillings, which has been discussed in this
newsletter many times. Benaphores use an extra atomic variable to
eliminate the need for entering the kernel in low-contention situations.
</p><p>
This does much to help solve the first problem, especially as contention
will be low for this type of fine-grain locking, but the second issue is
still just as bad. Solving this second problem is of great concern when
dealing with the kind of small devices to which we're expanding our
platform support, as RAM is a valuable and scarce resource on these
devices. Each semaphore takes up 33 bytes at a minimum, plus whatever
overallocation malloc makes for a structure of this size, plus four more
bytes in the kernel for a pointer to the semaphore in the global
semaphore list and another eight in user space to store the semaphore ID
and the benaphore atomic variable. This adds up to around (depending on
the behavior of malloc) 52 bytes for every benaphore. There's also a hard
limit, set by the kernel, on the number of semaphores that can be
allocated.
</p><p>
This is a locking primitive we're talking about here. Not a terribly
exciting piece of code. But let's make it as complicated as possible:
let's say I have a bunch of resources—oh, say, twenty thousand items
-- and I need to be able to lock each and every one of them separately.
Memory is precious. Contention is low. What's the ideal solution? In this
situation, semaphores (or benaphores) aren't even an option without some
changes to the kernel. I cleverly chose the figure twenty thousand for a
reason: the BeOS kernel allows a system-wide maximum of 16384 semaphores
in any configuration. Even if we could use benaphores, by our estimation
the benaphores alone would consume almost a megabyte of RAM!
</p><p>
We could use some kind of many-to-one scheme where one semaphore is used
to lock many resources. But then we may be locking things we don't need,
and we may introduce dependencies between resources that we'd rather
avoid. What we'd like is an ultra-lightweight locking primitive. It needs
to take up the minimum amount of memory, perform well in the anticipated
situation (i.e., low contention), and, above all, it needs to include my
name somewhere in it.
</p><p>
Enter the gehnaphore! The gehnaphore is a locking primitive that uses
only a single 32-bit atomic variable. For synchronization, it uses the
fairly obscure <code class="function">send_data()</code>/<code class="function">receive_data()</code> API. These calls provide a
one-message-deep message queue which is associated with each thread. Some
people look at these calls and see a largely deprecated API which was
subsumed by the generalized port API. I, on the other hand, see an
opportunity to flex my monstrous ego.
</p><p>
Gehnaphores use the compare-and-swap operation to perform atomic updates
to the 32-bit variable. This operation can easily and efficiently be
implemented on multiprocessor PowerPC or Intel machines, and actually has
its own instruction on the CISCy Pentium. The code I've included only has
the Intel implementation, but the PowerPC version is equally trivial.
</p><p>
There are two trade offs to using gehnaphores. First, you probably should
not depend on being able to play nice with other code that uses
<code class="function">send_data()</code>/<code class="function">receive_data()</code>; this should not be a big concern in most
code. Second, and more importantly, there will be a performance hit under
contention: if there are N threads waiting for a gehnaphore when it is
released by the holding thread, there will be N context switches (or N-1
more than you might expect) before the next thread in line can access the
critical section. This is because threads in the queue must "chain" the
lock release to the first thread in line for the lock, which is actually
the *last* thread in the chain. Their performance is thus virtually
identical to benaphores for a one or two thread situation, but gets worse
and worse as the amount of contention goes up. This is a significant
enough reason to not use gehnaphores for general purpose locking that
might be subjected to high contention, but is acceptable under the
constraints we've been given.
</p><p>
Gehnaphores use only four bytes per lock, and require kernel calls only
when they cause blocking. They thus have the performance advantages of
benaphores (aside from the caveat listed above) but use one thirteenth of
the memory. They also do not require a kernel call to create and destroy
a semaphore (the 32-bit value need only be initialized correctly), or
take up an entry in the kernel semaphore list. They are probably ideal
for most ultra-fine-grain locking situations. Basically, they totally
kick the benaphore's ass. Heh, heh, heh...
</p><p>
I've also written a multiple-reader/one-writer gehnaphore which uses a
whopping sixteen bytes. For very fine-grained locking, something like
this is probably overkill, but there might be situations where it would
make sense to use them. I'll leave it as one of my famous "exercises for
the reader" to implement this (you can put the solution in the same
directory as all the code you wrote to extend <span class="trademark">QuickPaint</span>™).
</p><p>
The code follows. You'll need to pull out the assembly snippet into a <code class="filename">.S</code>
assembly file and link with it in order to get the <code class="function">compare_and_swap32</code>
function. Remember: changing the name of the class is a violation of the
licensing agreement. Yeah, I know you were planning on it.

Part 2 of this series is unfortunately not ready yet. We will publish no
code before its time. Please stay tuned to this channel.
</p><p>
I do have one correction to last week's article. The recommended
device-naming scheme begins numbering at "1"; i.e., the CPiA driver
should publish <code class="filename">/dev/video/usb/CPiA/1</code> for the first camera,
<code class="filename">/dev/video/usb/CPiA/2</code> for the second, and so on.
</p><p>
While you're waiting for Part 2, I recommend reading and rereading the
article at &lt;http://www.b500.com/bepage/driver.html&gt;. In my humble
opinion, it's still the best general treatment of writing BeOS drivers
there is. And I was paid nothing for that endorsement.
</p><p>
Also, if you have Maui, you can install the CPiA driver from Part 1 and
make it do a few tricks. To install the CPiA driver, put it in
<code class="filename">/boot/home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin</code>, then make a link to it
from <code class="filename">/boot/home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/video/usb/</code>. In other
words, when you're done you should have something similar to
</p><pre class="screen">
$ dir /boot/home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/video/usb/ total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 tt users 0 Mar 22 04:51 CPiA -&gt;
/boot/home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/CPiA*
</pre><p>
P.S.: for Maui, I've added a rule named driverinstall to the
makefile-engine located in <code class="filename">/boot/develop/etc</code>. If you're using the
makefile-engine, and you set <code class="envar">DRIVER_PATH</code> in your makefile to the desired
path of your driver relative to <code class="filename">/dev</code>,
you can type make driverinstall to
properly install your driver. For example, check out the CPiA makefile.
You'll see the line
</p><pre class="screen">
DRIVER_PATH = video/usb
</pre><p>
Once you've installed CPiA, try using BeOS's nifty rescan command on it
when you have serial debugging turned on. Invoke it from the command line
like so:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ rescan CPiA
</pre><p>
rescan causes the kernel to reload a driver. In so doing it calls several
of the driver's exported functions. With CPiA's copious serial debug
output, you should get a good idea of when and how these and other CPiA
functions are called. rescan takes the name (not the path) of the driver
binary as its parameter. You can also run the test harness (<code class="filename">test.cpp</code>) to
see some of CPiA's hook functions being called.
</p><p>
If you don't have Maui, you can try rescanning whichever drivers you find
in <code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin</code>, but most shipping
drivers are not nearly as verbose as CPiA. Some are downright speechless.
</p><p>
Hot tip: did you know that you can look at serial debugging output even
if you don't have anything hooked up to the serial port? The command tail
shows you the end of a file, and if you use the  -f  option it continues
showing lines as they are added to the file. If you turned on serial
debugging at boot by hitting <span class="keysym">Delete</span> or <span class="keycap">F1</span>, you can type
</p><pre class="screen">
tail -f /var/log/syslog
</pre><p>
into a terminal to watch serial debug output as it happens. Cool!
</p><p>
Warm tip: check out the kernel settings file in
<code class="filename">/boot/home/config/settings/kernel/drivers/sample/</code>. If you make it an
active settings file by moving it up to the drivers directory, you can
control the behavior of syslog and serial debug output without having to
remember which keys to hold down when.

As you can imagine, I get a good deal of e-mail. Real e-mail-- what's
left after a CTRL-T on offers for descramblers; various life-enhancing
regimens, substances, or surgery; get-rich schemes; spying or
counterspying techniques. When we screw up, I hear about it, and I'm
grateful. Strongly worded feedback gives us a chance to correct a
specific situation, or to discover a more systemic problem. Silent spite
can kill a business, so I view complaints as opportunities.
</p><p>
Other mail is congratulatory. Since we know we still have much to do and
much to prove, encouragement along the way is appreciated. Such mail
sometimes comes from unexpected places: recently we got mail from the
Greek army. We also get suggestions, ranging from porting our OS to
various processors to writing drivers for a hot card to helping revive
the Amiga. These, too, are much appreciated. We don't agree with all of
them; some we strongly disagree with, because we must focus our resources
according to certain priorities.
</p><p>
In any event, we welcome the input for several reasons. For one, we are,
of necessity, myopic, and having an outside perspective is healthy.
Furthermore, how many good ideas does one really need per year? One or
two, maybe. I know it's fashionable to complain about e-mail volume, but
personally, I prefer to filter it myself and retain the portion that
brings feedback and ideas.
</p><p>
With this in mind, I'll share part of a message I got from Steve
Klingsporn on his Top Ten Reasons for liking BeOS (at some point, I'll
get to his unabbreviated list). Steve worked at Be many moons ago and has
kept a strong, informed interest in our work. Steve had this to say about
the introduction of BeOS 5...
</p><p>
"If I worked for Be, I would do the following:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Introduce BeOS 5 with the free version amidst as much
fanfare as possible.
</p></li><li><p>
Spend a little money on web and print and maybe radio
advertising—plenty of volunteers available to help --
to get the word out.
</p></li><li><p>
Put out press releases touting the power in having the
same operating system on recent PCs and on new types of
devices/IAs.
</p></li><li><p>
Follow up strong on the BeOS 5 free release with the
release of BeOS Pro and BONE/OpenGL/Java/etc., two to
four months thereafter.
</p></li><li><p>
Continue pursuit of BeIA adoptees. Move BeIA
technologies to BeOS where appropriate and have
common/new APIs.
</p></li><li><p>
Tie the desktop and device versions together in a really
data-compatible way, maybe with a unified object/messaging
format."
</p></li></ul><p>
This is very much our philosophy for introducing BeOS 5. Details may vary
here and there, but basically Steve is right. We're proud of our product
and we want BeOS 5 to reach as many current and potential new users as
possible. In doing this we want to broadly advertise our technology,
including its strengths for media-rich Internet Appliances. As one of our
recent press releases claims, we have more than 100,000 preregistrations
for the free, downloadable version of BeOS 5. We look forward to a good
launch. And lots more e-mail...
