And
I want to offer apologies. We were not prepared for the response, the
volume of inquiries and the interest from software developers and
prospective customers. As a result, many of you found the timing and
quality of our response lacking. Please accept my apologies.</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id468249"></a>What Are We Doing About It?</h3></div></div></div><p>We are hiring and we are using the Web. On the hiring side, we now have CK
Kaun, Valérie Peyre, and Maureen Miller respectively in charge of developer
technical support, responding to customer and press inquiries, organizing
demo days and trade shows and other public events. As you can see on our
Web page, we're still hiring and hopefully will continue on that mode for a
long time, albeit under less pressure.</p><p>However, before we address our Web page, a word on infrastructure, company
size and the type of individuals we are looking for. Many of us worked for
large, prosperous and benevolent companies. We also found out that work
became compartmentalized and politicized. As a result, customers got a
product that inevitably reflected the size, style and mores of the group
producing the product. Some tasks, such as picking detritus of a beach, can
be effectively compartmentalized . Others, such as scaling a North face,
cannot. We hope you see in our product the work of a few people who made
all decisions (in HR-speak, empowerment) over a large span of the product.
For instance, Steve Horowitz wrote the user-interface browser (the user
shell), all by himself, Benoit Schillings did most of the database engine,
the graphics engine and the file system and Joe Palmer the motherboard. And
our VP of Engineering, player coach as he is, wrote the kernel with Cyril
Meurillon. Soon I'll have exhausted the whole engineering roster. You got
the idea, we are looking for people who can carry on their shoulders and
inside their minds a broad range of our activities. Be these sales,
marketing, administrative or engineering. This will allow us to respond
more flexibly and more creatively to the opportunities - or the crises. If
you think you can help us grow this baby, e-mail (text only) your resume to
jobs@be.com or fax it to (415) 462-4129.</p><p>Now, the Web. You have seen the beginning of our use of the Web as a tool
to make our relationship more pleasant and more productive. Your questions
and comments feed the evolving FAQ section and we will continue to put all
our technical documentation on our site. We will not stop at programming
manuals, diagrams, pictures of the product and the team. We will publish
programming examples and the source code of the applications we've written,
or that others will let us publish. We will do the same for the drivers
we've written for graphics, networking and other add-on cards. Perhaps
we'll get the occasional egg on our code, that'll be good for our soul, and
it will help you modify these for your own use or in writing your own.</p><p>As always, please let us know what you think, what we should emphasize or
do differently—not that you've been shy thus far. We enjoy the feedback
and the discussions. They're fun and fruitful.</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering1-1"></a>Be Engineering Insights</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Erich</span> <span class="surname">Ringewald</span></span></div></div></div><p>What were they thinking? The thought has crossed each of our minds at one
point or another, when confronted with some new product or API. There's no
doubt that this thought will cross the minds of not a few of our developers
as they explore the Be system. In this space each issue we'll pick a
subject that we get questions about, and let the engineer responsible
explain the design choices, describe what they feel are the merits and
drawbacks of their approach, perhaps give tips and techniques on how best
to use a certain feature, and generally try to give you the developer a
better understanding of what went on in the design of the machine. Not that
we expect to replace or circumvent the documentation; the Be Book is still
your reference for the API.</p><p>So, generally speaking, what were we thinking when we set out to create
this machine? Well, first and foremost, we wanted to make available to
developers a collection of technologies we thought were cool, technologies
which weren't showing up on the mainstream platforms of Wintel and Mac. We
wanted to make the machine lean, cheap, and fast—things not many people
are accusing the mainstream platforms of being. And we wanted to help
change the model of software distribution; with the emergence of the
Internet and more specifically the Web, we wanted software to be
distributed electronically, with frequent updates to take advantage of new
features (and fix the inevitable bugs) as responsively as possible.</p><p>What new technologies were important to us? Well, to understand this you
must understand a bit of the background of the engineers at Be. Most, but
not all of us come from Apple. This has been, I think, both good and bad.
There was certainly a lot to learn from the Mac about UI and consistency,
ease of use, and an elegant "look and feel". From the point of view of OS
technology, the Mac is not the place to look for great insights. So luckily
we have team members with a fairly healthy dose of experience with other,
even more real Oss.</p><p>So our OS certainly owes more of its multitasking, multiprocessor heritage
to UNIX, Mach, Chorus, et al than it does to the Mac Segment Loader. We
thought it was time to try to offer a system with the look and feel
elegance of the Mac, with a real OS underneath. I really don't think any
system out there has delivered on that promise as we have. (X Windows is
not very popular here at Be).</p><p>Supporting multiple processors also was a very important factor. There is
just no excuse for a multitasking personal computer which is expected to
maintain user responsiveness, display multimedia data types, and manage a
sophisticated communications protocol to the net not to have more than one
processor to throw at the jobs. Compatibility with legacy applications
prevents the big guys from doing this (it's not because they're not smart
—I can't say that because even we didn't do it when we were at Apple).
That's the good news about the size of our installed base—it hasn't
prevented us from bringing these technologies to the market, at what I
think is a very reasonable price. Over the next few issues, we'll go into
some detail of the technologies we think are important in our machine, why
we did them at all, and why we did them the way we did. I hope that this
sort of information will make for interesting reading, as well as helping
you better understand the potential of this new machine.</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Support1-1"></a>Developer Relations Corner</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="authorgroup">By <span class="author"><span class="firstname">C.K.</span> <span class="surname">Haun</span>, </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Valérie</span> <span class="surname">Peyre</span>, </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Christophe</span> <span class="surname">Droulers</span></span></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id467792"></a>Who are developers?</h3></div></div></div><p>Developers are people who want to make something happen with a BeBox.</p><p>A developer is a single person working on a photo slideshow application or

interests to all segments of Be engineering, marketing, sales, or whatever
else. We know that if we can't do something, or if we can't find the answer
easily, then neither can you. Our job is to go through the pain first, so
you don't have to. We'll be doing that by creating sample code, keeping
Q&amp;A; information current and accurate, answering your individual questions,
creating events to attend, and other things.</p><p>We'll be doing that by listening to you, reading everything you write to
us, and asking questions to help us better understand your needs.</p><p>Be is a small company, and the developer relations group is a small part of
a small company. This means that we will need some help to be able to give
the best service to you. This corner of the Be newsletter will be the place
where we'll talk about upcoming developer issues, and keep you informed
about upcoming events and software releases.</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DevProfile1-1"></a>Be Developer Profile</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">C.K.</span> <span class="surname">Haun</span></span></div></div></div><p>This section of the Be Newsletter is devoted to YOU, the person or people
