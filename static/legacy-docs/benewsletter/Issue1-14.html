Release 1.1d7 of the <span class="trademark">Be OS</span>™ will support loadable device drivers.
Hardware developers will now be able to write drivers to support their
unique hardware designs. This article provides an overview of device
driver design for the Be OS.
</p><p>
The Be OS features an "add-on" facility for dynamically loading object
files and linking them to running applications. Device drivers are
implemented the same way, except that they're kernel add-ons. The kernel
looks for drivers at boot time in the /boot/system/drivers directory.
Each driver provides a few well-known external symbols that the kernel
uses to enumerate which devices the driver supports and the entry points
for the five calls for accessing each device (open, close, control, read,
write). The device names are made available under the /dev
pseudo-directory.
</p><p>
Note: One problem with the current design is that the name space is not
all visible, symmetric, and otherwise perfect. In a Terminal window, you
can't enter "<code class="command">cd /; ls -l</code>" and see all
the mounted volumes, or "<code class="command">cd /dev;
ls -l</code>" to show all the available devices. We hope to fix this in the
future, probably when we integrate support for external file systems.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id476496"></a>Static vs. Dynamic Drivers</h3></div></div></div><p>
Device drivers come in two flavors: Static drivers, which support a fixed
set of devices known at compile time; and dynamic drivers, which
determine what devices can be supported at run time.
</p><p>
Static drivers are identified by the presence of the "devices" external
symbol. This is a table of <span class="type">device_entry</span> structures, each having a device
name and function pointers for the five calls.
</p><p>
Dynamic drivers are identified by the presence of the
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/DeviceDrivers_WritingDrivers.html#publish_devices"><code class="function">publish_devices</code></a>
external symbol. This a function that returns a
table of pointers to device names. The function is called when the driver
is first loaded, and also later when someone tries to open a device with
a name the kernel has not yet seen. Dynamic drivers also must provide the
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/BView.DeviceDrivers_WritingDrivers.html#find_device"><code class="function">find_device</code></a>
external symbol to return the <span class="type">device_entry</span> structure
for a particular name that was published.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id476554"></a>Kernel Services</h3></div></div></div><p>
Drivers are extensions of the kernel. They're loaded in the kernel
address space, and are called with the processor's supervisor mode
enabled. They usually install interrupt handlers. Driver code must be
sensitive to issues of reentrancy, interrupt-level execution, scheduling,
and virtual memory. The kernel exports many services to make it easier
for your drivers to perform a number of tasks, including:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Getting information about PCI devices
</p></li><li><p>
Installing interrupt handlers for either the ISA-standard 8259
interrupt controller or Be's (faster) interrupt controller
</p></li><li><p>
Creating critical sections in the driver code that interrupt handlers
and regular calls can share
</p></li><li><p>
Locking and unlocking virtual buffers in physical memory (for devices
that use DMA)
</p></li><li><p>
Locating the disparate physical memory blocks that comprise a
contiguous virtual buffer
</p></li><li><p>
Setting up the ISA 8237 DMA controller
</p></li><li><p>Sending debugging information out serial port 4 and a
<a class="link bebook" href="../BeBook/DeviceDrivers_Functions.html#kernel_debugger"><code class="function">kernel_debugger()</code></a>
call</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id476630"></a>ISA vs. PCI</h3></div></div></div><p>
The PCI bus is fast, and the ISA bus is, well, ISA. Where else can you
find a $19 Ethernet card? The BeBox has both PCI and ISA, and kernel
services to support them.
</p><p>
ISA devices usually are hardwired to one of the IRQ lines on the ISA bus
(we don't support ISA Plug-And-Play yet). If the device depends on the
edge-sensitive interrupt controller found in the PC world, it uses the
kernel routine <code class="function">install_isa_interrupt_handler</code> to attach its handler to a
particular IRQ in the ISA interrupt dispatcher. If it can generate a
level-sensitive interrupt, it uses the <code class="function">install_io_interrupt_handler</code> call
to attach to the appropriate ID in Be's interrupt dispatcher. Be's
interrupt dispatcher is a bit faster.
</p><p>
PCI devices always use Be's interrupt mechanism. The driver code looks up
the PCI device (using the <code class="function">get_nth_pci_info</code> call), extracts all the
information about how the device has been mapped into the system, and
also extracts the interrupt ID to use.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id476675"></a>Critical Sections</h3></div></div></div><p>
Device drivers often include a sequence to access a data structure or
hardware registers that must be done atomically, both in the regular
routines and in the interrupt handler. The kernel exports routines for
implementing these critical sections.
</p><p>
<code class="function">disable_interrupts()</code> and <code class="function">restore_interrupts()</code> control the interrupt
enable on the current processor and <code class="function">acquire_spinlock()</code> and
<code class="function">release_spinlock()</code> control access between CPUs. A typical sequence is:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="type">cpu_status</span>    <code class="varname">old_status</code>;
<span class="type">spinlock      *</span><code class="varname">lock</code>;

<span class="comment">/* assumes lock was initialized */</span>
<span class="comment">/* with create_spinlock() when driver was loaded */</span>

<code class="varname">old_status</code> = <code class="function">disable_interrupts</code>();
<code class="function">acquire_spinlock</code>(<code class="varname">lock</code>);

<span class="comment">/* do stuff in this critical section */</span>

<code class="function">release_spinlock</code> (<code class="varname">lock</code>);
<code class="function">restore_interrupts</code> (<code class="varname">old_status</code>);
</pre><p>
Applications would typically use a semaphore to accomplish this. Drivers
typically don't want to be rescheduled before entering the critical
section, and must therefore use these kernel primitives.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id476786"></a>Special Rules for Interrupt Handlers</h3></div></div></div><p>
The goal of an interrupt handler is to do its job quickly and exit.
Polling hardware, lengthy data structure manipulations, and other
time-consuming operations are discouraged. The typical sequence for an
interrupt handler is:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Read/write the new data or status that caused the interrupt
</p></li><li><p>
Manipulate the hardware to deassert the interrupt
</p></li><li><p>
Optionally, release a semaphore that will unblock some thread waiting
for the interrupt to have occurred
</p></li></ul><p>
Releasing the semaphore must happen after all hardware manipulations, as
it may cause a reschedule. Rescheduling at the end of the handler is safe
-- the interrupted thread will run again soon enough, and exit the
interrupt handler at that time.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id476831"></a>Conclusions</h3></div></div></div><p>
Loadable device drivers provide a flexible mechanism for supporting a
wide variety of hardware in the BeBox. Many cards already exist for the
PCI and ISA bus architectures. Starting with release 1.1d7, we can all
start writing drivers for the Be OS to support this wealth of existing
hardware, as well as inventing new devices tuned to the unique
capabilities of the BeBox.

No one can deny that the Internet is going mainstream. Just flip through
the latest issue of Life magazine and you'll see web sites in the print
advertisements from Buick, Toyota, and Plymouth. Can Publishers
Clearinghouse Sweepstakes e-mail entries be far behind, we wonder?
Probably not, if John Buckman, principal of Shelby Group, Ltd., has
anything to do with it. And they just might be using the BeBox to do it.
</p><p>
Buckman's company has been developing Internet software for four years.
Currently they're focusing on helping organizations with large,
geographically distributed customer bases take better advantage of the
communications capabilities of the Internet. That's why his company, a Be
developer, is developing WorldBase, an e-mail list server for managing
e-mail lists and facilitating group discussions on the Internet.
</p><p>
"Besides being far less expensive than postal mail, electronic mail
allows highly targeted information distribution. Current e-mail list
servers were written ten years ago and can't handle the load of the 'new'
Internet. Because they process things one at a time, large jobs can
easily bog down and delay other jobs. When you're dealing with large
e-mail lists, this is a very real problem. A new approach needs to be
taken."
</p><p>
Buckman sees great potential for the BeBox as a cost-effective,
user-friendly alternative to UNIX for serious applications. "We're
targeting the BeBox as a server platform, because PC and Macintosh
clients don't care what server platform you're running. With its
scalability and strong multithreading, the BeBox is the perfect vehicle
for an e-mail list server for today's Internet. With its friendly graphic
interface and low cost, we think we can entice people to buy a BeBox to
try out WorldBase."
</p><p>
Magazine publishers, for example, have been talking to Buckman about
their desire to distribute massive amounts of electronic information
using e-mail list servers. "There needs to be a solution for these kinds
of customers. I'm hoping a $10,000 super-BeBox will be a far more
attractive proposition to them than a $100,000 UNIX server."
</p><p>
The BeBox's scalability is particularly attractive to Buckman. "I'm
selling a server program that needs to accommodate varying loads of use.
Small users will probably buy the Windows or Macintosh versions of
WorldBase. However, many companies will phase-in Internet software. They
might start with a pilot project of ten mailing lists of 5,000 people on
each list. And if that succeeds, they'll try to put 50,000—even
500,000—people on each list. Scalability is key, and the BeBox has it."
</p><p>
When people ask Buckman why he's developing WorldBase for the Be
platform, he puts it this way: "Do you want the power, scalability, and
robustness of the best UNIX platforms as well as something that's as easy
to set up and use as a Macintosh? If so, then you need a BeBox!"
</p><p>
WorldBase is written from the ground up in C++, allowing for easy
deployment on multiple platforms including Windows 95/NT, OS/2,
Macintosh, Be OS, and several UNIX platforms. It is also programmable,
and includes interfaces to popular databases including Oracle and Sybase.
</p><p>
Shelby Group, Ltd. hopes to release WorldBase for the BeBox in the Fall
of 1996.

What are these Apple stories? David Coursey writes a leading industry
newsletter, PC Letter. In an issue immediately following our first public
appearance at Agenda, David reviewed the BeBox rather kindly, making more
than passing reference to Apple. At the same time, Stewart Alsop ran an
InfoWorld editorial equating the BeBox to what Apple could have, should
have done. These articles amused a few insiders. Thankfully, no one else
seemed to pay much lasting attention.
</p><p>
Two weeks ago, David Coursey wrote a more pointed lead piece in an open
letter to Dr. Gil Amelio, Apple's brand new Chairman and CEO. Open
letters are a regular and often tart feature of PC Letter. Many CEOs,
from Jim Manzi to Lou Gerstner, have thus received advice ranging from
acquisitions to resignation. This time Dave gravely informed Dr. Amelio
that yours truly had never left Apple. Be was, in fact, a super-secret
Apple project, a skunk works team designing the next generation
Macintosh. In spite of the tongue-in-cheek tone of the piece and the
explicit "not true" at the end, it has been taken seriously, generated
some interesting, incredulous, or nervous e-mail.
</p><p>
While discussing speculation might have the perverse effect of giving it
more currency, I think this is a good opportunity to set the record
straight on this and other related Apple matters.
</p><p>
While we're honored and amused by the idea, we're not an Apple skunk
works. But, in a way, we are. About half of us come from Apple. As a
result there is a real and perceived connection. Then again, about half
of us own and operate Psion pads. This doesn't make us a secret Psion
business unit.
</p><p>
Seriously, we need to acknowledge our debt to the old company. Living
inside the sausage factory, we gained an appreciation for the
difficulties of incrementally evolving system software and developed a
hunger for a simpler life, technically and organizationally. We gained a
better understanding of the relationship between the mores, the size, the
spending habits, the politics of an organization and its output, the
product. When we showed our work to Taligent employees late last year,
they cheered. They said, "This is Pink." Indeed, after the Macintosh II
shipped in 1987, we started thinking about life after Macintosh. What had
we learned, what would we do if we were granted a fresh start, a blank
slate? These conversations led to a project called Pink, later
transferred to the Apple-IBM joint venture, Taligent, subsequently
abandoned when the two companies felt there was no promise in a new
operating system. In August 1990, two months before I got off the Apple
payroll, I had a casual conversation with John Sculley at a Claris party.
The disagreements leading to my resignation in February 1990 were behind
us and we were both in a good mood. I told John I needed to get one more
thing off my chest before leaving. I suggested he cancel Pink and blame
it on me. The project had grown too big, too rich, too fat, with too many
politically correct goals, trying to have both feet firmly planted in the
past and in the future. The corporate lymphocytes, hard to avoid in a
large organization, had selected away the kind of hard-ass leadership
needed for such a project, someone like Dave Cutler driving Windows NT. I
felt responsible and wanted the situation rectified. The problem wasn't
solved until much later, but we're richer for the experience.
</p><p>
And, yes, David Coursey must have pretty good antennae, or sources at the
highest level at Apple. A year ago, I met with Michael Spindler and the
subject of cross-licensing came up. I felt, and still feel, we were in
the same PowerPC camp and I suggested we enter a cross-licensing
agreement. Michael suggested we focus on the upcoming Common Hardware
Reference Platform (called PPCP this week): Licensing the MacOS would be
a much simpler matter and it could offer the Be OS a nice playing field.
Hence my earlier statements here: "We'll be happy to help and benefit as
the new platform gains momentum. But this is for the 1997 horizon." The
other side of the cross-licensing agreement would have been access to the
Be OS. I suggested it, perhaps prematurely, as some kind of insurance
against Copland being beset by the same problems that affected Pink. As
we know, nothing came of these discussions. Dave could have been
prescient; instead he was only inspired, or well informed.

After several weeks of presence, Be is gaining interest in countries all
over Europe and beyond. Developer Forms have come in from Reykjavik to
Vladivostok. Some of these developers have been programming on their
BeBoxes for months, while others will receive machines in April. We've
even seen alpha versions of some applications.
</p><p>
Who is doing what and where? The following tables should give you an idea
of how BeBoxes and Be developers are distributed across Europe (as of
February 29):

At Be, we believe that developers should have as much contact with each
other as possible. During the GeekFest, we invited developers to fill out
Developer Exchange forms. The information we collected through these
forms will be available soon on the new Be Europe web site
(http://www.beeurope.com). This new site also includes a mirror of the
American Be web site.
</p><p>
If you didn't get a chance to fill out a Developer Exchange form, or if
you'd like to update the public information concerning your application,
we encourage you to send this information to us. By posting news of your
work, your colleagues will have the opportunity to contact you and share
ideas, suggestions—and maybe even bugs.
</p><p>
To continue in our effort to meet our developers—and to introduce you
to each other—we're preparing a European tour for April. We're
planning to give presentations, answer questions, and in general, provide
a gathering place for Be sympathizers in a number of cities. If you're a
registered Be developer, if you're thinking about it, or even if you just
want to see the BeBox, simply get in touch with our office in Paris
(droulers@BeEurope.com) for a copy of our itinerary. Tell your friends!
We haven't yet determined the exact places where these events will take
place (we plan to start the tour in England and then swing through
Scandinavia and Germany). We'll try to arrange our visits so we can meet
as many of you as possible—so let us know where you are and we'll try
to come to you. If you have access to an assembly place (a university or
school hall, a large meeting room, or a similar venue), or if you can
offer advice on good places to meet in your area, we'd love to hear about
it. Finally, we have changed our e-mail addresses. Use these for any
questions you have regarding European topics:
