I don't, but I have at least 11 friends who can play instruments and
sing. With the coming of Maui, we can all jam together and record the
results using BeOS and an appropriate third-party software package.
That's because we've introduced support for multichannel audio devices
and file formats out-of-the-box. This means some additions to the Media
Kit API that I'll go over in this article.
</p><p>
First out, the <span class="type">media_raw_audio_format</span> struct needed to be enhanced to
convey information about things like how many bits of an <span class="type">int32</span> sample are
actually valid data, and which channels are assigned to which logical
speaker positions or matrix channels. Unfortunately,
<span class="type">media_raw_audio_format</span>
had no padding to take, so we invented <span class="type">media_multi_audio_format</span>
which is the same thing, plus the extra fields, plus padding.
<span class="type">media_format</span>.<code class="varname">u</code>.<code class="varname">raw_audio</code>
is now a <span class="type">media_multi_audio_format</span>, as is
<span class="type">media_raw_audio_format</span>::<code class="varname">wildcard</code>.
Because of the wonders of C++ inheritance, most
of your code will compile unchanged, but you'd do well to string-replace
all occurrences of "media_raw_audio_format" with
"media_multi_audio_format".
</p><p>
The new fields in <span class="type">media_multi_audio_format</span> are:
</p><table class="variablelist"><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="varname">channel_mask</code></span></p></td><td><p>
Contains a bit mask of the logical channel assignments
present in the format. If there are more channels in the format than
bits in this bit mask, the rest of the channels are undefined. Channel
assignments include <code class="constant">B_CHANNEL_LEFT</code>,
<code class="constant">B_CHANNEL_RIGHT</code>, <code class="constant">B_CHANNEL_CENTER</code>,
<code class="constant">B_CHANNEL_SUB</code>, <code class="constant">B_CHANNEL_REARLEFT</code>,
<code class="constant">B_CHANNEL_REARRIGHT</code>, and about 10
more that you can find in
<code class="filename">MediaDefs.h</code>
or the next version of the BeBook.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="varname">valid_bits</code></span></p></td><td><p>
Contains a count of how many bits of an <span class="type">int32</span> sample
actually contain valid data. The rest of the bits may contain
out-of-band data, zeros, or noise. If this value is 0, assume the
entire value is valid.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="varname">matrix_mask</code></span></p></td><td><p>
Contains a bit mask for which matrix encoding format
was used, if any, for the data. These include <code class="constant">B_MATRIX_PROLOGIC_LR</code> and
<code class="constant">B_MATRIX_AMBISONIC_WXYZ</code>. Currently, the Be System Mixer does nothing
with this information, but I think an Ambisonic "renderer" Node would
be an excellent and fun application using the Be Media Kit.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Unfortunately, struct <span class="type">media_encoded_audio_format</span> contained a
<span class="type">media_raw_audio_format</span> with no extra padding, so the extra fields have been split
out into a <code class="varname">multi_info</code> field of type <span class="type">media_multi_audio_info</span>.
<span class="type">media_multi_audio_format</span> actually multiplies inherits from
<span class="type">media_raw_audio_format</span> and
<span class="type">media_multi_audio_info</span> for this reason. Something to be aware of when
you're coding away.
</p><p>
There were some other places in the Media Kit which used a naked
<span class="type">media_raw_audio_format</span> without padding; most notably the constructor for
<code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code>. <code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code>
has thus gotten a new constructor which takes
not only a <span class="type">media_multi_audio_format</span> argument, but also a <span class="type">media_node</span> and
<span class="type">media_input</span>, so that you can point it at the Node/input of your choice.
This is a good way to send data directly at one of what may be many
installed sound devices, without involving the Be System Mixer (which
does stereo-only output in Maui).
</p><p>
Judging from questions I've received, I feel it is worth reiterating:
<code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code> is NOT being retired, but the
helper class <code class="classname">BSound</code> IS being
retired. Any bugs filed against <code class="classname">BSound</code> will go unfixed. The header may
disappear at any moment. There may be secret code in the media server
that deletes the header file <code class="filename">Sound.h</code>
from your hard disk at some random date in the future. If you can't just
use a <code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code> directly (either by overriding
<code class="methodname">PlayBuffer()</code> or by using the hooks) then I suggest
you look into <code class="classname">BGameSound</code> and its most-derived
classes <code class="classname">BSimpleGameSound</code>,
<code class="classname">BFileGameSound</code> and
<code class="classname">BPushGameSound</code>. Indeed, while most of the high-end
Media Kit is gone in our separate "Stinger" product for Internet
appliances, <code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code> and
<code class="classname">BGameSound</code> are still part of that product.
<code class="classname">BSound</code> is not.
</p><p>
As far as file formats go, we've added support for the new
<code class="constant">WAV_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE</code> flavor of WAV files that was recently defined. Our WAV file
writer and extractor will transparently read/write this flavor when
dealing with formats that are not unambiguously describable using the old
style of WAV header. Thus, if you use our WAV writer to write a 16-bit
stereo file, that file will play fine on a friend's system running some
other operating system product, whereas a 4-channel or 24-bit file may
not, as his OS may not yet be prepared to deal with those files.
</p><p>
What about recording? This article comes with sample code for two
utilities, one that plays a sound file back at the named sound device of
your choice (from the command line) and one which records a multichannel
file from the device of your choice. I've tried these with the Layla from
Echo, a 10-in 12-out 20-bit device, and it works there; your system may
vary. Feel free to snarf the parts of the sample code that you need into
your own application, as long as you don't use that code for a non-BeOS
product.
</p><p>
Sample Code: &lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/media_kit/multiaudio.zip&gt;
</p><p>
While debugging the new format negotiation in <code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code>, we found some
more ill-behaved applications which pass bad format descriptions to the
<code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code> constructor, and/or don't actually check which format is
being used but assume some format which happened to be chosen on their
system when they wrote the program. We've inserted code to stay
compatible with these programs, but I suggest that you make sure to look
at the format used by a <code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code> and conform to that; don't just
blithely assume some specific format, even if that's what you ask of it
or what it has used in the past.
</p><p>
One humorous e-mail exchange started with, "I'm fixing bugs in
app-name-deleted and it can't play audio anymore; it comes out as noise."
It seems the developer had assumed floating-point samples, but changed
the code to actually check and use whatever the <code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code> wanted (in
this case, <span class="type">int16</span>). Our workaround for the old version of the program
assumed he was still giving us floats, and thus noise came out. The
solution for him was to change his application's <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> signature, which is
the information we use in <code class="classname">BSoundPlayer</code> to activate possible application
bug workarounds.
</p><p>
That said, you cannot assume that we'll cushion bugs in your code as we
update the system. Some bugs are deemed too hard to work around or too
egregious in nature to support, and a user upgrading the OS will see
those applications stop working. Sometimes, we don't even have a copy of
the application to test with, so we can't find the bug in the first
place. Writing code that follows the rules is always your best defense.
Check error codes, check modified non-const arguments, and don't assume
any parameters (buffer size, sample format, etc.) will stay fixed just
because they're on your machine.
</p><p>
One simple test is to run your program with "Real-Time Audio" enabled and
disabled (restart media services in between) as enabling this option will
make audio buffers smaller (how much depends on your sound card and CPU)
and disabling it will make them bigger.
</p><p>
Are you one of the developers who reported sound glitch bugs with the
<span class="application">MediaPlayer</span> application? You're not alone. It turns out that the
<span class="application">MediaPlayer</span> was violating the "one clock" rule, and dropping/doubling
buffers of audio when the audio stream played at a slightly different
speed than <code class="function">system_time()</code>. <code class="constant">B_DONT_DO_THAT</code>. It also had a knack for
tickling a bug in the mixer which resulted in faint "sparkles" in the
sound. Both problems have been fixed as I write this article.

Along with personal jetpacks and submarine cars, documentation at your
fingertips is one of those cold war promises that we've been looking
forward to kicking and screaming. It's not enough to fish around for hard
copy tucked open and face down under a pile of unprotected hard drives
that we think we're going to get around to looking at again someday when,
actually, they've long since been permanently de-gaussed by the janitor
that doesn't work here anymore. All that amusing e-mail, gone.
Expectations have been raised to such an upper shelf that we no longer
tolerate the 10 mile snow trudge to explicitly open the on-line
documentation and perform a search in the manner of the ancients. We want
our tools to work for us. We want compilers that can correct the typos
that our autocompleters create. We want servers that autodetect our
network cards and software that deletes the spam that arrives
therethrough. And we want to point to a function and say "Tell me about
it."
</p><p>
As we all should know by now, the <span class="application">BeIDE</span> responds to this request, and has
since about the winter of 19-aught-98. <span class="keysym">Alt</span> double-click a symbol defined
by Be in the <span class="application">BeIDE</span> editor, and the documentation for the symbol pops open
in a browser window (more or less).
</p><p>
But let's say you have your own library with HTML documentation. How can
you play in this game?
</p><p>
Simple. So simple that I'm going to have to pile a few more pointless but
oh-so-sassy and probably grammatically correct nonsequiturs onto just
about every sentence in order to plump this article up to a size that
won't get lost somewhere between the legitimate technical discussion
above and the agitprop that follows. I could bang my head on the
keyboard, for all this paragraph is going to tell you. 567rytuifghvbn
567tyuighjvbnm 4675tyuighjkvnbm.
</p><p>
When the <span class="application">BeIDE</span> goes looking for a symbol, it creates a query that looks
for files of type "application/x-vnd.Be-doc bookmark". Each such file
represents a single symbol definition (function, class, constant, etc) in
the Be Book. The file's name is the symbol itself; functions retain their
parentheses, but without arguments (e.g. <code class="methodname">MessageReceived()</code>). The file
type is associated with four special attributes:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="varname">be:class_name</code> is the name of the class (or programming entity, such
as "Threads", or "Tracker Add-ons") that the symbol is defined in.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">be:kit_name</code> is the name of the kit the symbol is part of.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">META:url</code> is the location of the documentation for the symbol. For
example, the location of the <code class="methodname">PushGameSound::CurrentPosition()</code> function
is:
</p><p>
file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/The%20Game%20Kit/
PushGameSound.html#CurrentPosition()
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="varname">be:short_description</code> is a short description for the symbol.
</p></li></ul><p>
The <span class="application">BeIDE</span> lookup logic doesn't depend on the
<code class="varname">be:class_name</code>, <code class="varname">be:kit_name</code>,
or <code class="varname">be:short_description</code> attributes—all it cares about is finding a
symbol (i.e. a filename) that matches (or contains) the current
selection. The attributes are used, however, to differentiate multiple
hits.
</p><p>
If you want the <span class="application">BeIDE</span> to find your documentation, all you have to do is
create a "application/x-vnd.Be-doc bookmark" file for each of your
symbols, fill out the attributes, and put the files anywhere you want
(except the Trash). The BeIDE query isn't restricted to the Be Book
bookmark directory, which is somewhere inside the
don't-look-here-oh-okay-go-ahead-and-look /boot/beos phone closet.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee4-49"></a>Opera on BeOS</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
As most BeOS followers have known for a while, the BeOS version of Opera
has been making steady progress. I've used successive betas over the past
three months and have been happy with the experience. Opera is a
Norwegian company located in Oslo. Founded in 1995 by Jon Stephenson von
Tetzchner and Geir Ivarsøy, it acquired a very good reputation for the
quality of its independently developed browser. Opera 3.6 is now
commercially available on Windows, with versions planned for Unix
variants, MacOS, Epoc (the system inside the Psion organizers now
spreading to other devices) and OS/2. More details are available at
www.opera.com.
</p><p>
When you read Opera's home page, you can't miss their references to
bloatware (their word, not mine). In fact, the commercial Windows version
download needs 1.29 Mbytes and the application, once it's installed,
requires 2.68 Mbytes. That's just a little more than Neoplanet itself,
merely a "skin" for Explorer. Today, you can try Opera on Windows for 30
days and see how well it compares with the integrated offering from
Microsoft. For BeOS, there's the beta release already mentioned.
</p><p>
If you try it, I'm confident that you'll see why the technology and
product philosophy are attractive to us, and why we've entered into a
joint development and licence agreement with Opera for their browser. The
legal agreement is a little more wordy than this last sentence, but the
idea is to give us the opportunity to produce a nice BeOS version of
their market-tested browser. More details are available in the press
release and related material available at
&lt;http://www.be.com/press/pressreleases/99-12-08_opera.html&gt;
</p><p>
Now, you might ask, why did we pick Opera over NetPositive? We looked at
the two products and saw Opera as a clearly more evolved, functionally
richer product. We've known the small group of people who produce it for
awhile and respect their work. In licensing browser technology, we follow
the example of our worthy elders: Explorer is built on a Spyglass
license, and Navigator on code licensed from the NCSA at the University
of Illinois.
</p><p>
A better browser, "integrated" or not, makes BeOS a better platform for
desktop and appliance applications. And that's what the Be community --
developers, users, and business partners—get as a result of this
agreement. Looking back, we see this Opera agreement as being in line
with recent technology and business agreements, such as Java and Real
Networks. We're delighted with this opportunity to work with a fine group
of people and to make our product more competitive.
