We've been telling you since the beginning that threads are neat and
wonderful. A number of Newsletter articles have been written on how to
increase parallelism in your applications by creating more threads and
synchronizing them. Here are a few of those articles:
</p><p>
<a class="xref" href="Issue3-32.html#Engineering3-32" title="Be Engineering Insights: Fun with Threads, Part 1">Be Engineering Insights: Fun with Threads, Part 1</a><br />
<a class="xref" href="Issue3-33.html#Engineering3-33" title="Be Engineering Insights: Fun with Threads, Part 2">Be Engineering Insights: Fun with Threads, Part 2</a><br />

<a class="xref" href="Issue1-4.html#Engineering1-4" title="Be Engineering Insights: Summer Vacations and Semaphores">Be Engineering Insights: Summer Vacations and Semaphores</a>
</p><p>
All this is good, but it helped create the impression that programmers
who spawn more threads are smarter than others. This perhaps led to some
abuse and excess, with what appears to be a contest between some
programmers for who will spawn the most threads. This doesn't really come
as a surprise. Since multithreading is a relatively new programming
model, some abuse is to be expected.
</p><p>
Abuse—or excessive use—of multithreading can cause a number of
problems. First, threads are not free. It's true that they are
lightweight. A BeOS thread is not as heavyweight as a typical UNIX
process—for example, the address space and file descriptors are shared
between teams. But they do use up precious system resources: memory,
semaphores, etc.
</p><p>
For a start, each thread has a stack, which has to be allocated and
consumes memory. How much memory? It depends on the thread, as stack
pages are allocated on demand. But worse is the fact that the kernel
stack—the part of the stack which is used when the thread runs in the
kernel—has to be preallocated and locked down in memory—it can't be
paged out to disk. This is about 32K of memory per thread that you can
kiss goodbye. In addition, there are kernel structures used to keep the
thread state, some of them stored in locked memory as well. As a result,
20 threads eat up approximately 1M of memory. That's a lot.
</p><p>
Perhaps you don't care: you are writing an application targeted to
high-end users with plenty of memory. And you're telling me that memory
is cheap these days anyway. I could argue that this approach tends to
make systems fatter and slower. But I have something more important to
warn you about. By creating more threads and having to synchronize them,
you greatly increase the risks of deadlocks. That risk does not increase
linearly with the number of threads, but with the number of possible
interactions between threads—which grows much faster.
</p><p>
Since I'm discussing interactions between threads, it might be useful to
distinguish between different kinds of multithreading.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id536325"></a>Regular Multithreading</h3></div></div></div><p>
The threads are executing the same code on different data, and there is
very little interaction between them. Typically, applications dealing
with computations that can be easily parallelized, as on images, resort
to this technique. Servers can also fire a thread for every client
request, if the request is complex enough. For this type of
multithreading, synchronization between the different threads is usually
quite basic: the control thread fires all the computing threads and waits
for them to complete.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id536336"></a>Irregular Multithreading</h3></div></div></div><p>
The threads interact in a complex manner. Each thread can be seen as an
active agent that processes data and sends messages to other agents.
Media Server nodes are an example of such an organization.
Synchronization is usually complex. It can be of the producer-consumer
type, using ports. Or it can be customized, based on basic tools like
semaphores or shared memory.
</p><p>
It is clearly not a universal classification. Just a simple way to look
at multithreading from the standpoint of interaction complexity.
</p><p>
With regular multithreading, adding threads does not add to the overall
complexity of the application, because the additional threads don't
interact between themselves. On the other hand, adding threads in the
context of irregular multithreading increases complexity because the
additional threads do interact between themselves.
</p><p>
My warning about the increased risk of deadlock clearly only concerns
applications that use irregular multithreading. The risk of deadlock is
high, and quickly gets beyond anybody's comprehension as the number of
threads involved becomes larger than just a few. These deadlocks are
usually non-trivial, and it might prove useful to review some of the
classic scenarios:
</p><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id536377"></a>With nested semaphores:</h4></div></div></div><p>
In an architecture where semaphores are nested, it's critical that the
semaphores are always acquired in the same order by all the threads. If
thread A acquires semaphore a and then semaphore b, and thread B acquires
b and then a, a deadlock occurs. This gets increasingly complicated as
the number of nested semaphores and threads increases.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id536394"></a>With producer-consumer synchronization:</h4></div></div></div><p>
It's easy to run into a circular dependence. The loop can involve two or
more threads. With two threads, A sends a request to B that sends itself
a request to A. If the requests are synchronous, the deadlock appears
right away. In the asynchronous case, the message queue A is reading from
has to be full for the deadlock to be triggered. This makes it hard to
localize these bugs, and that can remain hidden for a long time. A
standard but terrible work-around for these bugs is to increase the
message buffer size... In addition, circular dependence that involves
loops with more than two threads is difficult to find.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id536406"></a>With reader/writer synchronization:</h4></div></div></div><p>
A simple implementation of reader/writer synchronization involves a
counted semaphore initialized with a count of N. Readers acquire the
semaphore with a count of one, writers with a count of N. This
implementation allows up to N concurrent readers. But what if a reader
wants to become a writer? You might think that it should acquire N-1, but
this leads to a deadlock if there is another writer in the wait queue of
the semaphore. The correct technique is to release as a reader and
reacquire as a writer.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id536417"></a>With benaphores</h4></div></div></div><p>
(see <a class="xref" href="Issue1-26.html#Engineering1-26" title="Be Engineering Insights: Benaphores">Be Engineering Insights: Benaphores</a>)
</p><p>
Benaphores were invented by Dr. Benoît Schillings in the infancy of BeOS.
They look like semaphores, taste like semaphores, and they're faster. But
they lost some features offered by kernel semaphores. This means you
can't always take an application and replace its semaphores by benaphores.
</p><p>
Specifically:
</p><p>
Benaphores require all the threads using the benaphore to live in the
same address space, as they rely on shared memory. Semaphores are
systemwide.
</p><p>
It's illegal to acquire a deleted benaphore. Acquiring a deleted
semaphore guarantees to return <code class="constant">B_BAD_SEM_ID</code>. Semaphore deletion can hence
be used to synchronize two threads. Not benaphore deletion.
</p><p>
Benaphores cannot be acquired with a count greater than 1 in the general
case. For example, implementing the previous reader/writer
synchronization using benaphores will lead to deadlocks in the case there
is more than one thread asking for write access. Think of the following
scenario:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The benaphore is initialized. Initial benaphore count: N. Its
associated semaphore has a count of 0.
</p></li><li><p>
Thread A gets read access. The benaphore count decrements to N-1.
</p></li><li><p>
Thread B asks for write access. The benaphore count decrements to -1.
But it is preempted before it acquires the semaphore with a count of 1.
</p></li><li><p>
Thread C asks for write access. The benaphore count decrements to
-1-N and C waits on the associated semaphore with a count of N.
</p></li><li><p>
Thread B finally waits on the semaphore with a count of 1.
</p></li><li><p>
Thread A releases its read access. It should unblock B, waiting for
its write access. The benaphore count increments to -N and the
semaphore is released with a count of 1. Unfortunately, C "passed" B in
the semaphore queue, and C won't be released because it's waiting with
a count of N.
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
I remember my initial experience of C++, and I can't help thinking of
developers confronting multithreading for the first time. My first
reaction to C++ was enthusiasm. I was very excited about seemingly neat
features like operator overloading and multiple inheritance. I used it
and abused it. What had to happen happened: I got trapped a number of
times by subtleties I did not grasp in the first place, many of them
being undocumented or compiler dependent. I almost became disillusioned
from getting burned so many times. But eventually, I got a good sense of
balance, knowing where to stop the house of cards I was building.
</p><p>
It's the same with multithreading: I believe all developers go through
the same phases of excitement, disillusion and eventually wisdom. I can
only recommend the greatest precautions when designing multithreaded
applications. It's tempting to push multithreading to its limits, using a
lot of threads that interact in complex ways. But it's always better to
start with an architecture you fully comprehend.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering4-6-2"></a>Be Engineering Insights: Using Archived Interface Objects</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Baptiste</span> <span class="surname">Queru</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Many developers ask how to archive interface objects and reuse them
later. There are several reasons why you'd want to do that—here are
the main ones:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
It makes sharing the work among a team much easier. One person can
design the UI, while another actually writes the code for it. It allows
non-programmers to design user interfaces, and programmers don't have to
change their code each time the user interface design changes.
</p></li><li><p>
It doesn't hard-code sizes, colors, layouts, texts, and most other
visible interface parameters, making it easier to create different
interfaces for the same app (the most striking example is
internationalization, but it's not the only one).
</p></li><li><p>
It makes it possible to write very little code in the app itself to
create the interface objects and put them on screen.
</p></li></ul><p>
That's enough marketing talk—this is "Engineering Insights" after all.
Let's see what has to be engineered—and here's the good news --
there's nothing you have to do, or, more accurately, very little.
</p><p>
Take a look at this example:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/interface_kit/archint.zip
</p><p>
It comes with a makefile. Compile it with <code class="command">make</code>, or use an alternate
resource with <code class="command">make alt</code>. Believe or not, both versions use the exact
same code (with no cheating by simply checking a resource flag and
changing the whole behavior of the app depending on this flag).
</p><p>
Now let's see the magic code, in <code class="filename">Application.cpp</code>:
</p><p>
The first part loads a <code class="classname">BMessage</code> from a resource (no great magic here):
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code>*</span> <code class="function">ReadMessageFromResource</code>(<span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">id</code>) {
  <span class="type">app_info</span> <code class="varname">ai</code>;
  <code class="classname">BFile</code> <code class="varname">f</code>;
  <code class="classname">BResources</code> <code class="varname">r</code>;
  <span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="varname">res_size</code>;
  <span class="type">const void*</span> <code class="varname">res_addr</code>;
  <code class="classname">BMessage</code>* msg=new <code class="classname">BMessage</code>;
  if ((<code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetAppInfo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">ai</code>)!=<code class="constant">B_OK</code>)
    ||(<code class="varname">f</code>.<code class="methodname">SetTo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">ai</code>.<code class="varname">ref</code>,<code class="constant">B_READ_ONLY</code>)!=<code class="constant">B_OK</code>)
    ||(<code class="varname">r</code>.<code class="methodname">SetTo</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">f</code>)!=<code class="constant">B_OK</code>)
    ||((<code class="varname">res_addr</code>=<code class="varname">r</code>.<code class="methodname">LoadResource</code>(<code class="constant">B_MESSAGE_TYPE</code>,<code class="parameter">id</code>,&amp;<code class="varname">res_size</code>))==<code class="constant">NULL</code>)
    ||(<code class="varname">msg</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Unflatten</code>((<span class="type">const char*</span>)<code class="varname">res_addr</code>)!=<code class="constant">B_OK</code>)) {
      delete <code class="varname">msg</code>;
      return <code class="constant">NULL</code>;
  }
  return <code class="varname">msg</code>;
}
</pre><p>
The second part creates the window from the <code class="classname">BMessage</code>; this is where the
magic lies:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">AWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">AWindow</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>* <code class="parameter">m</code>):<code class="classname">BWindow</code>(<code class="parameter">m</code>) {
  <code class="function">atomic_add</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">numwindows</code>,1);
  <code class="varname">numclicks</code> = <code class="parameter">m</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">FindInt32</code>("clicks");
  <code class="methodname">Show</code>();
}
</pre><p>
As you can see, there's nothing difficult here. You just call the base
class constructor and extract any extra data you might have stored in the
<code class="classname">BMessage</code>. You'll notice that I didn't define any
<code class="methodname">Instantiate()</code> function for my class, because I
knew which class was stored in the <code class="classname">BMessage</code>. If
you're doing something more complex (such as a multiple window interface),
you'll want to implement <code class="methodname">Instantiate()</code> so that you
can take a bunch of archived objects and feed them to
<code class="function">instantiate_object()</code>, which will do the job for you.
See the <code class="classname">BArchivable</code> chapter in the Be Book for more
details.
</p><p>
This last part shows why custom <code class="classname">BView</code>s are not needed:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">AWindow</code>::<code class="classname">MessageReceived</code>(<code class="classname">BMessage</code>* <code class="parameter">m</code>) {
  switch(<code class="parameter">m</code>-&gt;<code class="varname">what</code>) {
    case 'colr' : {
<span class="comment">// removed for clarity</span>
      break;
    }
    case 'dump' : {
      <code class="methodname">DumpArchive</code>();
      break;
    }
    case 'clon' : {
      <code class="methodname">CloneWindow</code>();
      break;
    }
    default:
      <code class="classname">BWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">MessageReceived</code>(<code class="parameter">m</code>);
      break;
    }
  }

<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">AWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">NewColor</code>(<span class="type">rgb_color</span> <code class="parameter">col</code>) {
  <code class="classname">BView</code>* <code class="varname">v</code> = <code class="methodname">FindView</code>("colorview");
  if (<code class="varname">v</code> != <code class="constant">NULL</code>) {
    <code class="varname">v</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetViewColor</code>(<code class="parameter">col</code>);
    <code class="varname">v</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Invalidate</code>();
  }
}
</pre><p>
The trick is that the default target for a <code class="classname">BControl</code>
is its <code class="classname">BWindow</code>, and a
<code class="classname">BWindow</code> can find <code class="classname">BView</code>s by name.
It's also a good idea to do some dynamic
type-checking on the <code class="classname">BView</code> returned by
<code class="methodname">FindView()</code>.
</p><p>
Now let's look at some drawbacks of using archived interface objects:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
You'll probably need one or two custom classes which are missing from the
current API. One is a <code class="classname">PictureView</code> (which simply
displays a <code class="classname">BPicture</code>, just as a
<code class="classname">BStringView</code> displays a String); another is a
<code class="classname">PictureRadioButton</code> (because the current
<code class="classname">BPictureButton</code> has no radio mode).
</p></li><li><p>
Unless you reverse-engineer their format, you won't be able to directly
create <code class="classname">BMessages</code> that contain archived
<code class="classname">BPicture</code>s. You'll have to create a
<code class="classname">BPicture</code> and <code class="methodname">Archive()</code> it.
</p></li><li><p>
For some reason, some <code class="classname">BView</code>s will ignore any
<code class="varname">ViewColor</code> and/or <code class="varname">LowColor</code> that's
stored in the archive, because those views adjust their
<code class="varname">ViewColor</code> and/or <code class="varname">LowColor</code> to match
those from their parent. Most of the time, this is what you want. If it's
not, you have two solutions: 1) you can manually override the colors in
your window constructor (see the example in
<code class="filename">Application.cpp</code>); or 2) you can enclose the
<code class="classname">BView</code> you want to "protect" into another
<code class="classname">BView</code> of the same size (see the example in
<code class="filename">AddAlternateResource.cpp</code>).

This is the first in a series of articles about programming with the new
Media Kit.
</p><p>
Soon there will be Media Kit add-ons available that provide support for
various video file formats. This week, let's take a look at how to play
back a movie using the new Media Kit and these add-ons.
</p><p>
You can download the code for this project at
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/media_kit/simplemovie.zip. It consists of
three C++ source files and two header files.
</p><p>
<code class="filename">main.cpp</code> instantiates the <code class="classname">MediaApp</code>
object, passing <code class="varname">argv[1]</code> to the object.
This argument should be the name of the movie to play (yes, this is a
command-line movie player, hence the name <code class="classname">SimpleMovie</code>).
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">MediaApp</code> constructor converts the movie's pathname into an <span class="type">entry_ref</span>
and passes that to a function called <code class="methodname">OpenRef()</code>, which will actually open
and begin playing the movie file. It also calls <code class="methodname">SetPulseRate()</code> to cause
the <code class="classname">MediaApp</code>::<code class="methodname">Pulse()</code> function to be called periodically; we'll use the
<code class="methodname">Pulse()</code> function to watch for the movie to end.
</p><p>
<code class="methodname">OpenRef()</code> looks like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code> *<code class="classname">MediaApp</code>::<code class="methodname">OpenRef</code>(<span class="type">entry_ref *</span><code class="parameter">ref</code>) {
  <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code> *<code class="varname">player</code> = new <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code>(<code class="parameter">ref</code>);
  if (<code class="varname">player</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">InitCheck</code>() != <code class="constant">B_OK</code>) {
    <code class="function">printf</code>("Can't set up the player\n");
    delete <code class="varname">player</code>;
    return <code class="constant">NULL</code>;
  }
  return <code class="varname">player</code>;
}
</pre><p>
All it has to do is instantiate a <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code> object
to represent the movie. The movie is started automatically by the
<code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code> constructor, so once this is done, the
movie is playing. If an error occurs setting up the movie,
<code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code>::<code class="methodname">InitCheck()</code> will return
<code class="constant">NULL</code>, and we throw away the object.
</p><p>
The <code class="methodname">Pulse()</code> function checks the movie periodically to see if it's done
playing:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">MediaApp</code>::<code class="methodname">Pulse</code>(<span class="type">void</span>) {
  if (<code class="varname">player</code>) {
    if (!<code class="varname">player</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Playing</code>()) {
      <code class="methodname">SetPulseRate</code>(0);    <span class="comment">// No more pulses, please</span>
      delete <code class="varname">player</code>;
      <code class="varname">player</code> = <code class="constant">NULL</code>;
      <code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(<code class="constant">B_QUIT_REQUESTED</code>);
    }
  }
  else {
    <code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(<code class="constant">B_QUIT_REQUESTED</code>);
  }
}
</pre><p>
This is done by calling the <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code>::<code class="methodname">Playing()</code>
function. If it
returns <code class="constant">true</code>, the movie is still playing; otherwise, the movie is done.
If it's done, we turn off pulsing by calling <code class="code">SetPulseRate(0)</code>, delete the
player object (which, as we'll see later, closes the various media
connections), and post a <code class="constant">B_QUIT_REQUESTED</code> message to ourselves to quit
the application.
</p><p>
If the <code class="classname">MoviePlayer</code> object, player, wasn't
opened properly and is <code class="constant">NULL</code>, we
post a quit request to bail out immediately.
</p><p>
Now we get to the meaty, "we've been waiting for this for two months"
part: the <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code> class. Before we begin, I should point out that
this class assumes that the video is encoded and that the audio is not,
and probably won't work right in any other case. It works fine for
playing typical Cinepak-encoded QuickTime movies, though. Because the
nodes aren't finished yet as I write this, this code isn't as flexible as
it could be.
</p><p>
The <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code> constructor's job is to find an appropriate node to
process the movie file and instantiate a copy of the node to be used to
actually perform the playback. It sets <code class="varname">playingFlag</code> to <code class="constant">false</code> (we use this
flag to keep track of whether or not the movie is playing), and obtains a
<code class="classname">BMediaRoster</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">roster</code> = <code class="classname">BMediaRoster</code>::<code class="methodname">Roster</code>();  <span class="comment">// Get the roster object</span>
</pre><p>
This static call in the <code class="classname">BMediaRoster</code> class returns a media roster we can
use. This object is used by all applications that interact with the Media
Kit; it acts as an intermediary between the application and the nodes
that provide media functionality.
</p><p>
Then it's necessary to identify a node that can handle the movie file
that the user specified. This is done by calling
<code class="classname">BMediaRoster</code>::<code class="methodname">SniffRef()</code>. This function looks at the file and returns a
<span class="type">dormant_node_info</span> structure that describes the add-on that's most
suitable for accessing the node.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">initStatus</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SniffRef</code>(*<code class="varname">ref</code>, 0, &amp;<code class="varname">nodeInfo</code>);
if (<code class="varname">initStatus</code>) {
  return;
}
</pre><p>
Note that errors are stashed in a member variable called <code class="varname">initStatus</code>; the
<code class="methodname">InitStatus()</code> function returns this value so the application can determine
whether or not the <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code> was properly initialized.
</p><p>
Once an appropriate add-on has been identified and information about it
stashed in <code class="varname">nodeInfo</code>, a node needs to be instantiated from that add-on.
Nodes located in media add-ons are referred to as "dormant nodes." We
call <code class="methodname">InstantiateDormantNode()</code> to accomplish this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">initStatus</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">InstantiateDormantNode</code>(<code class="varname">nodeInfo</code>,
  &amp;<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>);
</pre><p>
Since the <span class="type">media_node</span> <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code> is a file handling node, we next have
to tell the node what file to handle, by calling <code class="methodname">SetRefFor()</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetRefFor</code>(<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>, *<code class="varname">ref</code>, <code class="constant">false</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">duration</code>);
</pre><p>
This sets up the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code> to read from the specified <span class="type">entry_ref</span>. The
movie's length (in microseconds) is stored into the <span class="type">bigtime_t</span> variable
duration.
</p><p>
Now that the file node has been instantiated, it's time to instantiate
the other nodes needed to play back a movie. The <code class="methodname">Setup()</code> function handles
this; we'll look at it momentarily. After the <code class="methodname">Setup()</code> function returns
safely, <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code>::<code class="methodname">Start()</code> is called to begin playback.
</p><p>
<code class="methodname">Setup()</code> begins by locating the standard audio mixer and video output
nodes. These will be used to actually play the movie to the speakers (or
other audio output device, as configured in the Audio preference panel)
and to a window on the screen (or other video output device, as
configured in the Video preference panel):
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetAudioMixer</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">audioNode</code>);
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetVideoOutput</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">videoNode</code>);
</pre><p>
Next, a time source is needed. A time source is a node that can be used
to synchronize other nodes. By default, nodes are slaved to the system
time source, which is the computer's internal clock. However, this time
source, while very precise, isn't good for synchronizing media data,
since its concept of time has nothing to do with actual media being
performed. For this reason, you typically will want to change nodes' time
sources to the preferred time source. We get that using the following
code:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetTimeSource</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">timeSourceNode</code>);
<code class="varname">b_timesource</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">MakeTimeSourceFor</code>(<code class="varname">timeSourceNode</code>);
</pre><p>
The first call obtains a <span class="type">media_node</span> representing the preferred time
source to which we'll slave our other nodes. The second call, to
<code class="methodname">MakeTimeSourceFor()</code>, actually obtains a
<code class="classname">BTimeSource</code> node object for that
time source. This will be used in making calculations related to timing
later on, that can't be done through the media roster.
</p><p>
You can think of a media node (represented by the <span class="type">media_node</span> structure)
as a component in a home theater system. It has inputs for audio and
video (possibly multiple inputs for each), and outputs to pass that audio
and video along to other components in the system. To use the component,
you have to connect wires from the outputs of some other components into
the component's inputs, and the outputs into the inputs of other
components.
</p><p>
The Media Kit works the same way. We need to locate audio outputs from
the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code> and find corresponding
audio inputs on the <code class="varname">audioNode</code>.
This is analogous to choosing an audio output from your new DVD player
and matching it to an audio input jack on your stereo receiver. Since you
can't use ports that are already in use, we call <code class="methodname">GetFreeOutputsFor()</code> to
find free output ports on the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>,
and <code class="methodname">GetFreeInputsFor()</code> to
locate free input ports on the <code class="varname">audioNode</code>.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetFreeOutputsFor</code>(<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>,
        &amp;<code class="varname">fileAudioOutput</code>, 1, &amp;<code class="varname">fileAudioCount</code>,
        <code class="constant">B_MEDIA_RAW_AUDIO</code>);

<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetFreeInputsFor</code>(<code class="varname">audioNode</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">audioInput</code>,
        <code class="varname">fileAudioCount</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">audioInputCount</code>,
        <code class="constant">B_MEDIA_RAW_AUDIO</code>);
</pre><p>
We only want a single audio connection between the two nodes (a single
connection can carry stereo sound), and the connection is of type
<code class="constant">B_MEDIA_RAW_AUDIO</code>. On return, <code class="varname">fileAudioOutput</code>
and <code class="varname">audioInput</code> describe the
output from the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code> and the input into the <code class="varname">audioNode</code> that will
eventually be connected to play the movie's sound.
</p><p>
We likewise have to find a video output from the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code> and an
input into the <code class="varname">videoNode</code>. In this case, though, we expect the video
output from the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code> to be encoded, and the <code class="varname">videoNode</code> will want
to receive raw, uncompressed video. We'll work that out in a minute; for
now, let's just find the two ports:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetFreeOutputsFor</code>(<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>,
        &amp;<code class="varname">fileNodeOutput</code>, 1, &amp;<code class="varname">fileOutputCount</code>,
        <code class="constant">B_MEDIA_ENCODED_VIDEO</code>);

<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetFreeInputsFor</code>(<code class="varname">videoNode</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">videoInput</code>,
        <code class="varname">fileOutputCount</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">videoInputCount</code>,
        <code class="constant">B_MEDIA_RAW_VIDEO</code>);
</pre><p>
The problem we have now is that the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code> is outputting video
that's encoded somehow (in Cinepak format, for instance). The <code class="varname">videoNode</code>,
on the other hand, wants to display raw video. We need another node, in
between these, to decode the video (much like having an adapter to
convert <acronym class="acronym" title="Phase Alternating Line">PAL</acronym> video into
<acronym class="acronym" title="National Television System Committee">NTSC</acronym>,
for example). This node will be the codec
that handles decompressing the video into raw form.
</p><p>
We need to locate a codec node that can handle the video format being
output by the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>. It's accomplished like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">nodeCount</code> = 1;
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetDormantNodes</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">nodeInfo</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">nodeCount</code>,
        &amp;<code class="varname">fileNodeOutput</code>.<code class="varname">format</code>);
if (!<code class="varname">nodeCount</code>) {
  <code class="function">printf</code>("Can't find the needed codec.\n");
  return -1;
}
</pre><p>
This call to <code class="methodname">GetDormantNodes()</code> looks for a dormant node that can handle
the media format specified by the <code class="varname">fileNode</code>'s output <span class="type">media_format</span>
structure. Information about the node is returned in <code class="varname">nodeInfo</code>. <code class="varname">nodeCount</code>
indicates the number of matching nodes that were found. If it's zero, we
report that no codec was found.
</p><p>
Note that in real life you should ask for several nodes, and search
through them, looking at the formats until you find one that best meets
your needs.
</p><p>
Then we use <code class="methodname">InstantiateDormantNode()</code> to instantiate the codec node, and
locate inputs into the node (that accept encoded video) and outputs from
the node (that output raw video):
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">InstantiateDormantNode</code>(<code class="varname">nodeInfo</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">codecNode</code>);

<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetFreeInputsFor</code>(<code class="varname">codecNode</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">codecInput</code>, 1,
        &amp;<code class="varname">nodeCount</code>, <code class="constant">B_MEDIA_ENCODED_VIDEO</code>);

<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetFreeOutputsFor</code>(<code class="varname">codecNode</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">codecOutput</code>, 1,
        &amp;<code class="varname">nodeCount</code>, <code class="constant">B_MEDIA_RAW_VIDEO</code>);
</pre><p>
Now we're ready to start connecting these nodes. If we were setting up a
home theater system, right about now we'd be getting rug burns on our
knees and skinned knuckles on our hands, trying to reach behind the
entertainment center to run wires. The Media Kit is way easier than that,
and doesn't involve salespeople telling you to get expensive gold-plated
cables.
</p><p>
We begin by connecting the file node's video output to the codec's input:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">tryFormat</code> = <code class="varname">fileNodeOutput</code>.<code class="varname">format</code>;
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Connect</code>(<code class="varname">fileNodeOutput</code>.<code class="varname">source</code>,
        <code class="varname">codecInput</code>.<code class="varname">destination</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">tryFormat</code>,
        &amp;<code class="varname">fileNodeOutput</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">codecInput</code>);
</pre><p>
<code class="varname">tryFormat</code> indicates the format of the encoded video that
will be output by the <code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>.
<code class="methodname">Connect()</code>, in essence, runs a wire between the
output from the media node's video output
(<code class="varname">fileNodeOutput</code>) to the codec node's input.
</p><p>
You may wonder what's up with the <code class="varname">fileNodeOutput.source</code> and
<code class="varname">codecInput.destination</code> structures. These <span class="type">media_source</span> and
<span class="type">media_destination</span> structures are simplified descriptors of the two ends
of the connection. They contain only the data absolutely needed for the
Media Kit to establish the connection. This saves some time when issuing
the <code class="methodname">Connect()</code> call (and time is money, especially in the media business).
</p><p>
Next it's necessary to connect the codec to the video output node. This
begins by setting up <code class="varname">tryFormat</code> to describe raw video of the same width
and height as the encoded video being fed into the codec, then calling
<code class="methodname">Connect()</code> to establish the connection:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">tryFormat</code>.<code class="varname">type</code> = <code class="constant">B_MEDIA_RAW_VIDEO</code>;
<code class="varname">tryFormat</code>.<code class="varname">u</code>.<code class="varname">raw_video</code> = <span class="type">media_raw_video_format</span>::<code class="varname">wildcard</code>;
<code class="varname">tryFormat</code>.<code class="varname">u</code>.<code class="varname">raw_video</code>.<code class="varname">display</code>.<code class="varname">line_width</code> =
  <code class="varname">codecInput</code>.<code class="varname">format</code>.<code class="varname">u</code>.<code class="varname">encoded_video</code>.<code class="varname">output</code>.<code class="varname">display</code>.<code class="varname">line_width</code>;
<code class="varname">tryFormat</code>.<code class="varname">u</code>.<code class="varname">raw_video</code>.<code class="varname">display</code>.<code class="varname">line_count</code> =
  <code class="varname">codecInput</code>.<code class="varname">format</code>.<code class="varname">u</code>.<code class="varname">encoded_video</code>.<code class="varname">output</code>.<code class="varname">display</code>.<code class="varname">line_count</code>;

<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Connect</code>(<code class="varname">codecOutput</code>.<code class="varname">source</code>,
        <code class="varname">videoInput</code>.<code class="varname">destination</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">tryFormat</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">codecOutput</code>,
        &amp;<code class="varname">videoInput</code>);
</pre><p>
Now we connect the audio from the media file to the audio mixer node. We
just copy the <span class="type">media_format</span> from the file's audio output, since both ends
of the connection should exactly match.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">tryFormat</code> = <code class="varname">fileAudioOutput</code>.<code class="varname">format</code>;
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Connect</code>(<code class="varname">fileAudioOutput</code>.<code class="varname">source</code>,
        <code class="varname">audioInput</code>.<code class="varname">destination</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">tryFormat</code>,
        &amp;<code class="varname">fileAudioOutput</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">audioInput</code>);
</pre><p>
The last step of configuring the connections is to ensure that all the
nodes are slaved to the preferred time source:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetTimeSourceFor</code>(<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">timeSourceNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>);
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetTimeSourceFor</code>(<code class="varname">videoNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">timeSourceNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>);
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetTimeSourceFor</code>(<code class="varname">codecOutput</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">timeSourceNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>);
</pre><p>
The <code class="methodname">Start()</code> function actually starts the movie playback. Starting
playback involves starting, one at a time, all the nodes involved in
playing back the audio. This includes the audio mixer (<code class="varname">audioNode</code>), the
media file's node (<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>), the codec, and the video node. Because
there's lag time between starting each of these nodes, we pick a time a
few moments in the future for playback to begin, and schedule each node
to start playing at that time. So we begin by computing that time in the
future:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">GetStartLatencyFor</code>(<code class="varname">timeSourceNode</code>,
        &amp;<code class="varname">startTime</code>);

<code class="varname">startTime</code> +=
  <code class="varname">b_timesource</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">PerformanceTimeFor</code>(<code class="classname">BTimeSource</code>::<code class="methodname">RealTime</code>()
        + 1000000 / 50);
</pre><p>
The <code class="classname">BTimeSource</code>::<code class="methodname">RealTime()</code> static member function is called to obtain
the current real system time. We add a fiftieth of a second to that time,
and convert it into performance time units. This is the time when the
movie will begin (basically a 50th of a second from "now"). This value is
saved in <code class="varname">startTime</code>. These are added to the value returned by
<code class="methodname">GetStartLatencyFor()</code>, which returns the time required to actually start
the time source and all the nodes slaved to it.
</p><p>
Then we simply call <code class="classname">BMediaRoster</code>::<code class="methodname">StartNode()</code> for each node, specifying
<code class="varname">startTime</code> as the performance time when playback should begin:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">StartNode</code>(<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>, <code class="varname">startTime</code>);
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">StartNode</code>(<code class="varname">codecNode</code>, <code class="varname">startTime</code>);
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">StartNode</code>(<code class="varname">videoNode</code>, <code class="varname">startTime</code>);
</pre><p>
And we set <code class="varname">playingFlag</code> to <code class="constant">true</code>,
since we've now begun playback. At this
point (actually, a 50th of a second after this point, but who's
counting?), the movie will begin playing.
</p><p>
Notice that we don't start the audio mixer node (<code class="varname">audioNode</code>), and, as
we'll see shortly, we don't stop it, either. The audio mixer node is
always running, and an application should never stop it.
</p><p>
The <code class="methodname">Stop()</code> function stops movie playback by
calling <code class="methodname">StopNode()</code> for each
node. It then sets <code class="varname">playingFlag</code> to <code class="constant">false</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">StopNode</code>(mediaFileNode, 0, true);
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">StopNode</code>(codecNode, 0, true);
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">StopNode</code>(videoNode, 0, true);
<code class="varname">playingFlag</code> = <code class="constant">false</code>;
</pre><p>
The <code class="varname">true</code> values indicate that the nodes should stop playing
immediately, instead of at some time in the future. If we wanted the
nodes to stop in sync with each other, we could compute a performance
time slightly in the future, and specify that time instead.
</p><p>
The <code class="methodname">Playing()</code> function determines whether or not the movie is still
playing. Since we don't provide a pause feature, we can do this simply by
looking to see whether or not the current performance time is at or past
the end of the movie:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">currentTime</code> =
  <code class="varname">b_timesource</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">PerformanceTimeFor</code>(<code class="classname">BTimeSource</code>::<code class="methodname">RealTime</code>());

if (<code class="varname">currentTime</code> &gt;= <code class="varname">startTime</code>+<code class="varname">duration</code>) {
  <code class="varname">playingFlag</code> = <code class="constant">false</code>;
}
</pre><p>
Here we obtain the current performance time by taking the real time and
passing it through <code class="methodname">PerformanceTimeFor()</code>, then look to see if it's equal
to or greater than the starting time plus the movie's duration. If it is,
the movie's done playing.
</p><p>
Last, but not least, let's look at the <code class="classname">MediaPlayer</code> class destructor. It
handles disconnecting the nodes from one another:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="methodname">Stop</code>();
<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Disconnect</code>(<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">fileNodeOutput</code>.<code class="varname">source</code>, <code class="varname">codecNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">codecInput</code>.<code class="varname">destination</code>);

<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Disconnect</code>(<code class="varname">codecNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">codecOutput</code>.<code class="varname">source</code>, <code class="varname">videoNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">videoInput</code>.<code class="varname">destination</code>);

<code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">Disconnect</code>(<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">fileAudioOutput</code>.<code class="varname">source</code>, <code class="varname">audioNode</code>.<code class="varname">node</code>,
        <code class="varname">audioInput</code>.<code class="varname">destination</code>);
</pre><p>
This code makes sure playback is stopped (disconnecting currently playing
nodes is discouraged), then disconnects each of the three connections we
established in <code class="methodname">Setup()</code>. Then we need to let the Media Kit know we're done
with the nodes by releasing them. We don't release the video and mixer
nodes because we didn't actually instantiate them ourselves.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ReleaseNode</code>(<code class="varname">codecNode</code>);
<code class="varname">roster</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ReleaseNode</code>(<code class="varname">mediaFileNode</code>);
</pre><p>
Hopefully this sample code will be helpful in learning to write software
that uses the new Media Kit for playback of media data. Updates to the
Media Kit chapter of the Be Book are coming over the next few weeks (a
large <code class="classname">BMediaRoster</code> update is being reviewed for accuracy now and should
be available soon). Have fun!

Last week's column, "Another Bedtime Story" , triggered more mail than
usual. Most of it was positive, with some requests for clarification of
our position. Are we against browser integration—yes, no, and why? To
paraphrase a highly placed government official, it depends what the
meaning of "integration" is—and, one might add for precision, the
intent, manner and consequences of integration.
</p><p>
What we have today with <span class="application">Explorer</span> and Windows is what I'd call tentacular
integration. (I won't say here what the spellchecker on my diminutive
Toshiba Libretto offers as an alternative for tentacular, a word it
pretends not to know. It is in the American Heritage Dictionary and my
Libretto will run the BeOS once we get Toshiba to release the specs of
their sound chip.)
</p><p>
There is a single word for <span class="application">Explorer</span>, but the software itself has many
tentacles that reach deep inside the system. As a result, Microsoft seems
to be saying, a lot of damage will occur if you forcibly remove <span class="application">Explorer</span>.
Specifically, when the now famous "Felten program" attempted to remove
<span class="application">Explorer</span>, Microsoft wanted to show how Web access and navigation were
still possible, if you knew your way around Windows Registry, where a
myriad of settings are stored. <span class="application">Explorer</span> was so tightly integrated with
Windows that one couldn't really remove it, just hide and disable it.
</p><p>
Furthermore, as a result of this failed "<span class="application">Explorer</span>-ectomy," performance
suffered greatly. Sorry about that, said Microsoft, it's an imperfect
world, but through our efforts consumers benefit from tight integration.
</p><p>
I won't add to the sum of ironies provoked by the videotapes that tried
to persuade the courts of justice and public opinion of the soundness of
this argument. Thinking of Redmond's serene and understated culture, one
can imagine the sharing of thoughts following the discovery of
unfortunate editing miscues.
</p><p>
But if, as Microsoft contends, <span class="application">Explorer</span> is not a separate application so
much as an operating system upgrade—hence its size, depth, and
complexity—one might be tempted to explore that line of reasoning.
That is, the Web is important and is now tightly woven into our everyday
lives. Certainly, a mere application cannot do justice to such an
important and pervasive function. That responsibility belongs to the
platform, to the operating system.
</p><p>
Perhaps. But couldn't one make a similar argument about word processing,
spreadsheets, or presentations? Shouldn't these important functions also
be integrated into the operating system? Come to think of it, if
Microsoft Office isn't integrated with Windows, it comes pretty close for
millions of users who receive Office as a bundled, if not integrated,
product. The technical argument that one must "integrate" <span class="application">Explorer</span>, while
one can merely "bundle" Office doesn't withstand technical scrutiny. Take
two identical PCs loaded with a late version of Windows 95, OSR 2.1, or
later. Install (integrate if you prefer) <span class="application">Explorer</span> on one and Navigator on
the other, and compare performance. There's no significant difference.
</p><p>
If one reads carefully through Mr. Allchin's deposition and the language
used in various video demonstrations, one sees the words "rich" and
"richness" used to describe the improved user experience that results
from making elements of the user interface more Web-like. This poses
another question regarding the "how" of integrating Web capabilities
inside the operating system. To oversimplify a bit, couldn't Microsoft
have broken the job in two pieces—a system module and an application
module? This approach would make removing the application module a simple
and safe task. It would also make installing another browser—while
preserving the "richness" afforded to other applications by the system
module—easier. One might ask whether Microsoft had non-technical
motives in choosing a tentacular implementation instead of the modular
one.
</p><p>
Lastly, in reading the court transcript, Microsoft seems to allege that
the BeOS <span class="application">NetPositive</span> browser is "integrated," and cites the help system
as proof. If you trash <span class="application">NetPositive</span>, a simple operation, the help system
no longer works: it needs a now absent HTML interpreter. Ergo,
<span class="application">NetPositive</span> is integrated.
</p><p>
Assume for a moment that the help system is written in the format of an
editor supplied with the OS. If you delete the editor, you can no longer
read the help files. Unless, of course, you use a third-party editor.
Does this mean that the supplied editor is integrated with the OS? Of
course not. And what will Microsoft say when one or more of the
third-party browsers currently under development for the BeOS become
available and read the help file or the BeOS documentation—even if
<span class="application">NetPositive</span> is missing? Will that make them—ipso facto—integrated
with the BeOS?
