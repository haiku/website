When I go home in the evening, I sometimes use my BeOS machine for some
of my hobbies. I thought it would be fun to describe some of the things I
do, and why the BeOS works so well for them.
</p><p>
Recently, I became interested in extremely low-light imaging. There's a
device called an "image intensifier," which has the wonderful ability to
amplify any incoming light by a huge factor—up to 30,000 times,
without adding much noise. These devices are great, but often there's so
little light to work with (to take pictures of galaxies for instance)
that a single image appears "snowy." The snow is actually individual
photons detected by the system.
</p><p>
This is where a computer can work its magic. The intensifier tube is
re-imaged by a black and white video rate camera, its signal digitized by
a Hauppauge frame grabber ($129 at Fry's Electronics). The resulting data
is transferred by DMA using the Bt848 driver—and then the fun begins!
</p><p>
The first problem to deal with is the huge amount of data you get: One
second of recording gives you 9 megabytes of data! That kind of stream is
enough to keep even a 225 MHz system pretty busy. The second problem is
that a lot of processing needs to be done on the individual frames before
you can accumulate them.
</p><p>
The first step after grabbing a frame is to remove any systematic bias of
the camera and intensifier tube. You can do this by using some
calibration data that determines the fix bias and sensitivity of every
pixel.
</p><p>
In C you'd use:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
*<code class="varname">clean_pixel</code> = (*<code class="varname">src_pixel</code> - *<code class="varname">bias_map</code>) * (*<code class="varname">response_map</code>);
</pre><p>
After that, if you're imaging galaxies, you need to account for
atmospheric effects. Just like the heat rising over a road in summer, the
image you see through a telescope moves all the time, because of minute
temperature differences in the different layers of the atmosphere. To
compensate for that motion, you use a reference object in the image. You
measure the position of the object with a centroiding algorithm, which
measures the "center of gravity" of an area of the frame:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span>    <code class="function">centroid</code>(<span class="type">float *</span><code class="parameter">x</code>, <span class="type">float *</span><code class="parameter">y</code>)
{
    <span class="type">int</span>     <code class="varname">x</code>;
    <span class="type">int</span>     <code class="varname">y</code>;
    <span class="type">float</span>   <code class="varname">sum_x</code>;
    <span class="type">float</span>   <code class="varname">sum_y</code>;
    <span class="type">float</span>   <code class="varname">total_count</code>;

    <code class="varname">sum_x</code> = 0;
    <code class="varname">sum_y</code> = 0;
    <code class="varname">total_count</code> = 0;

    for (<code class="varname">y</code> = 0; <code class="varname">y</code> &lt; <code class="constant">FRAME_Y_SIZE</code>; <code class="varname">y</code>++)
        for (<code class="varname">x</code> = 0; <code class="varname">x</code> &lt; <code class="constant">FRAME_X_SIZE</code>; <code class="varname">x</code>++) {
            if (<code class="varname">pixel</code>[<code class="varname">y</code>][<code class="varname">x</code>] &gt; <code class="constant">THRESHOLD</code>) {
                <code class="varname">sum_x</code> += <code class="varname">x</code> * <code class="varname">pixel</code>[<code class="varname">y</code>][<code class="varname">x</code>];
                <code class="varname">sum_y</code> += <code class="varname">y</code> * <code class="varname">pixel</code>[<code class="varname">y</code>][<code class="varname">x</code>];
                <code class="varname">total_count</code> += <code class="varname">pixel</code>[<code class="varname">y</code>][<code class="varname">x</code>];
        }

    if (<code class="varname">total_count</code> == 0) {
        *<code class="varname">x</code> = 0;
        *<code class="varname">y</code> = 0;
    }
    else {
        *<code class="varname">x</code> = (<code class="varname">sum_x</code> / <code class="varname">total_count</code>) + 0.5;
        *<code class="varname">y</code> = (<code class="varname">sum_y</code> / <code class="varname">total_count</code>) + 0.5;
    }
}
</pre><p>
This great for tracking bright areas, and is accurate down to a fraction
of a pixel!
</p><p>
Now that you can stack individual frames after recentering them, you can
decide which frames to add to the image, and which to reject. Once again,
the atmosphere can degrade the sharpness of some frames but leave others
nice and clean. Therefore, you need to measure the sharpness of every
frame before adding it to the final image.
</p><p>
One easy way to measure the sharpness is to measure the amount of high
frequency in the current image. You could use a 2D FFT, but it's pretty
slow. Instead, you can measure only the very high frequencies by
computing:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">float</span>   <code class="function">sharpness</code>()
{
    <span class="type">int</span>     <code class="varname">x</code>;
    <span class="type">int</span>     <code class="varname">y</code>;
    <span class="type">float</span>   <code class="varname">sum</code>;
    <span class="type">float</span>   <code class="varname">delta</code>;

    <code class="varname">sum</code> = 0;

    for (<code class="varname">y</code> = 0; <code class="varname">y</code> &lt; <code class="constant">FRAME_Y_SIZE</code> - 1; <code class="varname">y</code>++)
        for (<code class="varname">x</code> = 0; <code class="varname">x</code> &lt; <code class="constant">FRAME_X_SIZE</code> - 1; <code class="varname">x</code>++) {
            <code class="varname">delta</code> = <code class="varname">pixel</code>[<code class="varname">y</code>][<code class="varname">x</code>] - <code class="varname">pixel</code>[<code class="varname">y</code> + 1][<code class="varname">x</code>];
            <code class="varname">sum</code> += <code class="varname">delta</code> * <code class="varname">delta</code>;
            <code class="varname">delta</code> = <code class="varname">pixel</code>[<code class="varname">y</code>][<code class="varname">x</code>] - <code class="varname">pixel</code>[<code class="varname">y</code>][<code class="varname">x</code> + 1];
            <code class="varname">sum</code> += <code class="varname">delta</code> * <code class="varname">delta</code>;
        }
    <code class="varname">sum</code> = <code class="varname">sum</code> / ((<code class="constant">FRAME_Y_SIZE</code> - 1) * (<code class="constant">FRAME_X_SIZE</code> - 1));
    <code class="varname">sum</code> = <code class="function">sqrt</code>(<code class="varname">sum</code>);

    return <code class="varname">sum</code>;
}
</pre><p>
After all that image processing, my 225 MHz BeOS system can handle only
25 frames per second. But since you reject part of the 30 frames per
second produced by the camera using the sharpness criteria, this is not a
problem. However, sharp frames seem to arrive in group, so you need to
decouple the image production from the image stacking process.
</p><p>
The program has a bunch of buffers that store images to be processed. A
producer thread receives the data from the frame grabber and measures the
image's sharpness. If the sharpness is better than the worst frame
currently in the buffers, that frame replaces the one stored in the
"offending" buffer. A second thread takes images out of the buffer pool
and processes them, and a final thread is responsible for displaying the
current stack of images.
</p><p>
I will bring this camera to the next developer conference, and show how
an image appears on the screen in near total darkness. The glow of a
watch is enough to illuminate a large room—and my BeOS machine is
happily crunching 9 millions pixels every second!
</p><p>
For people with little cameras like the QuickCam, many of the same
techniques can be used. One common QuickCam problem, for example, is that
some bright pixels overlay the image. The technique of measuring the fix
bias of the camera works well to remove them. Just take a few images in
the dark with the QuickCam and subtract their average from the images you
take in full light, and you'll get a much nicer result. If you have
questions about tricks you can do with CCD cameras, please e-mail me at
benoit@be.com.

I would like to put a plug in for the people at Be who support you, the
developer. The best way I can come up with to do this is by using
statistics.
</p><p>
But first, some typical questions we get from developers:
</p><div class="qandaset"><table border="0" summary="Q and A Set"><col align="left" width="1%" /><tbody><tr class="question"><td><a id="id613485"></a><a id="id613488"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Why can't you review my bug faster?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
There are three QA and one DTS engineers who look at
incoming developer bugs. Don't make the assumption that
this is all they do. Doug, our DTS guy, spends his days
answering e-mail and most of his nights writing source
code. The QA guys spend their days writing evil tests and
running them on unsuspecting machines. They also spend a
lot of time fixing broken hardware.
</p><p>
Here is where I poke you, the developer, to write better
bug reports. If you did, it wouldn't take us an average of
one hour to review a bug and we could look at more of
them.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id613512"></a><a id="id613514"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
How come my bug took a month to be reviewed?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
At nine bugs a day, each taking about an hour to review
and approve, we would need to dedicate one full-time
engineer to this process. We'd rather take a little longer
and save the money.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id613529"></a><a id="id613531"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Why don't you fix my bug?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
We do. See the statistics below.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id613543"></a><a id="id613545"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Why don't you implement my feature?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
We have implemented 44 feature requests. This is not
the greatest number, but remember that we are still
working on the basic functionality of the BeOS. We believe
that fixing crashing bugs and moving to other hardware
platforms is more important than implementing features. Be
patient. We are running out of hardware platforms and we
will get to your features in another couple of releases or
so.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id613563"></a><a id="id613566"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Why isn't there more documentation?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
We have two technical writers. In ten months they wrote
the 1000-page "Be Developers Guide" that O'Reilly
published in November 1997. As they finish documenting
more of the BeOS core functions, you will see more
documentation.
</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td><a id="id613581"></a><a id="id613583"></a>Q:</td><td><p>
Why can't the bug database do everything?
</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top">A:</td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
It is a work in progress. As soon as the bug database
guy, Ron, gets out of web hell (anticipated to be in about
5 months) he may have time to implement some of your
requests. (That's assuming more work doesn't come up.) Of
course, if all you developers want to donate about
$100,000 for a full-time bug database person, we wouldn't
say no.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Now for the statistics:
</p><p>
These numbers are all from developer reported bugs. They do not reflect
internal bugs (which we also find and fix).
</p><pre class="screen">
Average number of bugs reported by developers      9/day

Total number of developer bugs reported            2801
Number of actual, unique bugs reported             1456

Current number of bugs to be investigated          156
Current number of open feature requests            396
Current number of open bugs                        329

Total number of fixed bugs to date                 575

Percentage of developer bugs fixed for Pr2         38%

Average release length (history of Be)             4 months
</pre><p>
Let's summarize: We have one DTS engineer, three QA engineers, and
twenty-two development engineers working on the whole system. At this
very moment, the development engineers each have an average of 78 bugs or
features assigned to them. They also have to finish Intel, do their own
engineering work, and fix/find bugs. The reality is that we have to
prioritize things. Some bugs (those that affect a large number of people)
win, and some bugs (those that only affect one or two or even ten people)
lose.
</p><p>
Next time you're thinking about writing that flame-O-gram, ask yourself
if you have a workload like this and if so, what are your turn-around
times and percentages? Have empathy friends, we all are in this together!
</p><p>
Oh, and just for grins, why don't you ask Microsoft and Apple what their
statistics are?

"Developers' Workshop" is a new weekly feature that provides answers to
our developers' questions. Each week, a Be technical support or
documentation professional will choose a question (or two) sent in by an
actual developer and provide an answer.
</p><p>
We've created a new section on our website. Please send us your
Newsletter topic suggestions by visiting the website at:
http://www.be.com/developers/suggestion_box.html.
</p><p>
Two weeks ago I said I'd let you in on who the newest addition to
Developer Technical Support is. DRUMROLL...The new DTS Engineer
is...DRUMROLL...Stephen Beaulieu, formerly of Purity Software. Stephen,
take it away...
</p><p>
...Greetings all! I'm glad to be fighting the good fight here at
devsupport. As a long-time Be Developer I have personal experience of
what devsupport has done, right and wrong, in the past. Doug, Brian, and
I are looking forward to revamping devsupport to better meet your needs.
If you have concerns, problems, or (best yet) development questions,
please drop us a line through the online form in the Registered
Developers Area. If you've got questions, we've got answers (or will try
and find them for you). Stephen Beaulieu
</p><p>
...And now on with the show! This week I'm going to tell you more about
how to find information on programming for the BeOS. We've been busy
organizing all the information and sources available to developers from
our web site. In the next couple of weeks, you will see the fruits of our
labors appear in the developers section of the site.
</p><p>
Each of the BeOS programming sources is explained in detail below...

http://www.be.com/documentation/be_book/index.html
</p><p>
The BeBook is the complete programmer's reference to the BeOS API. It is
available on-line on BeOS CDs or in print as the "Be Developer's Guide,"
from O'Reilly and Associates. Currently, chapters on the Application Kit,
Storage Kit, Interface Kit, Kernel Kit, Device Kit, and Support Kit are
updated for PR1 and PR2. DR8 versions of the other kits are still
available, but are out of date. Our documentation team is hard at work
finishing the BeBook. As chapters are written they will be posted, and
O'Reilly will publish the complete book as the "Be Developer's Guide,
Volume 2."

The Be header files are included on all BeOS CDs and downloads. They are
the ultimate guide to programming for the BeOS. The easiest way to find
out exactly how to call a function or create a class is to check out the
header file. The headers are divided into the same Kits as the BeBook,
and are always up to date for the release with which they shipped. Find
them on your CD or HD in /boot/develop/headers/be. Header files for C++,
gnu, and POSIX are also in the /headers directory.

</p><p>
The web site's sample code section contains projects you can download or
view on a per file basis. There's also a search engine for checking all
the source and header files on-line. Keep in mind that not all our sample
code is up on the web site yet. You can find additional code on the ftp

http://www.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/article_index.html
</p><p>
The Be Newsletter is the most valuable source of hard core programming
information and inside jokes that Be has to offer. Each week a Be
engineer or two takes up a subject they know and care about deeply. This
information is often not yet available anywhere else. Past issues of the
Newsletter are available on-line, but it can be hard to find information.
That is why we're going back through every issue and indexing them by
topic. This is part of the work we are doing to enhance the Be Developer
web site.
</p><p>
Also each week, there's this column, the Developers' Workshop. It is
intended to help developers get up to speed with more basic BeOS
programming information, which isn't always easy. Your suggestions on the
information you need will help us deliver it to you in the Developers'
Workshop.

That's our complete source list of development information. In addition,
there are some third-party tutorials and sample code out there on the
web. We're trying to index as much of this as possible, so we can provide
links &gt;from the Be site. If you know of a third-party site or have one of
your own that provides sample code or tutorials, please let us know by
sending the URL to devservices@be.com.

I write this from a house in a Paris suburb, as I struggle to connect to
the 'Net and get my mail. It's supposed to work "seamlessly," but it's
broken. Be's office modems are busy, but I have a fallback position,
Compuserve, with POPs all over the world.
</p><p>
It does get me on the 'Net, but many California sites appear to be dead.
I ping be.com, best.com, sun.com, apple.com, sony.com and even
gassee.com. Only sun.com responds. Consumers can't conceive of a
telephone that doesn't give a dial tone when you lift the receiver, or a
TV that crashes. Imagine a media culture where, when you turn the set on,
you're not sure if the scheduled show or game will appear on screen.
</p><p>
This stuff isn't for my mother. Even a well-designed appliance such as
WebTV won't spare her some of these indignities because their source is
in the infrastructure. In a more positive light, we're still in the
pioneer years, with much fun and grief ahead of us, much experimentation,
many surprises, before the so-called "commoditization" sets in.
</p><p>
A year ago, we were looking with mixed feelings at an undone deal. Had we
missed an opportunity to be acquired by Apple, get broad distribution for
our work, and make our shareholders liquid, or were we saved from
joining, or re-joining, a company in trouble? Time will tell.
</p><p>
The best scenario is one where Apple goes on to recover a leadership
role, by innovation if not by size—and one where we gain critical mass
in the Intel space as a specialized media OS, coexisting with the
general-purpose OS, Windows.
</p><p>
After shipping several PowerPC releases in 1997, we are now distributing
a very small number copies of an Intel pre-release to BeOS developers.
The idea is to provide them with a test vehicle for moving their
applications to Pentium II hardware in preparation for MacWorld, held in
the first week of January 1998 in San Francisco. We'll have a broader
developer conference a little later, and PC Expo and Comdex for likely
milestones and coinciding release dates, with all the usual caveats
stipulated.
</p><p>
There is much work ahead of us in a space where we have to assume our
prior experience is of unknown value. Yes, we have a product, the PowerPC
releases have helped its maturing process, but the Intel playing field
isn't just bigger—we have to learn new rules. Fortunately, we have
already found supporters willing to guide us and, if the daily flow of
e-mail is to be believed, many users seem willing to give us a try --
which is all we ask. We need good word-of-mouth from bleeding edge users,
the opinion shapers.
</p><p>
Our old supporters have been very good to us in a year that started with
questions about our future. Be employees voted with their dedicated work,
shareholders with their funds, BeOS developers with a growing number of
applications and users with field reports showing they actually used the
product. To all, our heartfelt thanks and our best wishes for an exciting
New Year.
