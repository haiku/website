I've spent way too much time over the last four years reading and writing
frame buffer memory. Admitting that I have this problem is, for me,
cleansing. Almost spiritual. Let me share my enlightenment. And if you're
doing rendering using the Game Kit, or working with off screen bitmaps,
you might even find my confessions interesting.
</p><p>
The first thing that you realize when you use a fast machine (like my
beloved 225 MHz PowerPC) is that PCI is a pain. This thing is so slow
compared to the speed of the CPU that thinking a little bit about the way
you will access memory can have some nice paybacks.
</p><p>
For the next few examples, let's assume that the frame buffer is in
24-bit mode and has a width of 800 pixels.
</p><p>
The easiest way to draw a square 128 pixels wide is:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
#define  <code class="constant">BUFFER_BASE</code>  0x14000020
#define  <code class="constant">ROWBYTE</code>    (800*4)

<span class="type">void</span>  <code class="function">test1</code>()
{
  <span class="type">ulong  *</span><code class="varname">p</code>;
  <span class="type">ulong</span>  <code class="varname">my_color</code>;
  <span class="type">int</span>    <code class="varname">x</code>;
  <span class="type">int</span>    <code class="varname">y</code>;

  <code class="varname">my_color</code> = 0x00ff0000;    <span class="comment">// a nice red color.</span>

  for (<code class="varname">y</code> = 0; <code class="varname">y</code> &lt; 128; <code class="varname">y</code>++) {
    <code class="varname">p</code> = (<span class="type">ulong*</span>)(<code class="constant">BUFFER_BASE</code> + (<code class="varname">y</code> * <code class="constant">ROWBYTE</code>));
    for (<code class="varname">x</code> = 0; <code class="varname">x</code> &lt; 128; <code class="varname">x</code>++) {
      *<code class="varname">p</code>++ = <code class="varname">my_color</code>;
    }
  }
}
</pre><p>
On my machine with a Twin Turbo video card, this piece of code runs in
3550 usecs. This is a bandwidth of about 18 MB/sec. If we run the same
test using conventional memory, the code now runs in only 730 usecs --
about 5 times faster!! Excuse me, I have to get the phone.
</p><p>
I'm back. Moral #1: When you have a LOT of rendering to do, it's faster
to render in an off screen bitmap and then blit the final result to the
screen. This is even more apparent if you try to READ stuff out of the
buffer. If we change the previous code into
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
for (<code class="varname">y</code> = 0; <code class="varname">y</code> &lt; 128; <code class="varname">y</code>++) {
  <code class="varname">p</code> = (<span class="type">ulong*</span>)(<code class="constant">BUFFER_BASE</code> + (<code class="varname">y</code> * <code class="constant">ROWBYTE</code>));
  for (<code class="varname">x</code> = 0; <code class="varname">x</code> &lt; 128; <code class="varname">x</code>++) {
    *<code class="varname">p</code>++ ^= 0xffffffff;
  }
}
</pre><p>
The execution time now goes up to a hugely 15100 microseconds, 4.5 times
slower than the previous write only case. Say it not, reading the
contents of a PCI frame buffer is a bad idea! In real memory, it takes
only 800 microseconds. As you can see, the off screen method is the clear
winner.
</p><p>
Back to the simple writing case. It turns out that writing doubles into
the frame buffer helps the performance of the PCI transaction:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span>  <code class="function">test1</code>()
{
  <span class="type">double  *</span><code class="varname">p</code>;
  <span class="type">double</span>  <code class="varname">temp_double</code>;
  <span class="type">ulong</span>  <code class="varname">my_color</code>;
  <span class="type">int</span>    <code class="varname">x</code>;
  <span class="type">int</span>    <code class="varname">y</code>;

   <code class="varname">my_color</code> = 0x00ff0000;    <span class="comment">// a nice green color.</span>

  *((<span class="type">ulong*</span>)&amp;<code class="varname">temp_double</code>) = <code class="varname">my_color</code>;
  *(1 + (<span class="type">ulong*</span>)&amp;<code class="varname">temp_double</code>) = <code class="varname">my_color</code>;

  for (<code class="varname">y</code> = 0; <code class="varname">y</code> &lt; 128; <code class="varname">y</code>++) {
    <code class="varname">p</code> = (<span class="type">double*</span>)(<code class="constant">BUFFER_BASE</code> + (<code class="varname">y</code> * <code class="constant">ROWBYTE</code>));
    for (<code class="varname">x</code> = 0; <code class="varname">x</code> &lt; 128/2; <code class="varname">x</code>++) {
      *<code class="varname">p</code>++ = <code class="varname">temp_double</code>;
    }
  }
}
</pre><p>
This one runs in 1970 usec—about 50% better than the one using 32 bits
transfer!
</p><p>
If we unroll the loop...
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
for (<code class="varname">x</code> = 0; <code class="varname">x</code> &lt; 128/8; <code class="varname">x</code>++) {
  *<code class="varname">p</code>++ = <code class="varname">temp_double</code>;
  *<code class="varname">p</code>++ = <code class="varname">temp_double</code>;
  *<code class="varname">p</code>++ = <code class="varname">temp_double</code>;
  *<code class="varname">p</code>++ = <code class="varname">temp_double</code>;
}
</pre><p>
...we don't actually gain anything. This runs in exactly the same time as
the non-unrolled version. This is because any overhead between the write
instructions is hidden by the time taken to do the write. If you do some
computation between writes, you may find that it is free. For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
for (<code class="varname">x</code> = 0; <code class="varname">x</code> &lt; 128/2; <code class="varname">x</code>++) {
  *<code class="varname">p</code>++ = <code class="varname">temp_double</code>;
  <code class="varname">my_color</code> += (<code class="varname">x</code>&lt;&lt;24) | (<code class="varname">x</code> &lt;&lt; 8) ^ <code class="varname">x</code>;
  *((<span class="type">ulong*</span>)&amp;<code class="varname">temp_double</code>) = <code class="varname">my_color</code>;
  <code class="varname">my_color</code> += (<code class="varname">x</code>&lt;&lt;24) | (<code class="varname">x</code> &lt;&lt; 8) | <code class="varname">x</code>;
  *(1 + (<span class="type">ulong*</span>)&amp;<code class="varname">temp_double</code>) = <code class="varname">my_color</code>;
}
</pre><p>
It looks busy. It is busy. But this thing still runs in EXACTLY the same
time—so much for optimization! (By the way, this random piece of code
looks very nice if you run it a few thousand times, try it!)
</p><p>
Note that although the double write only needs to be aligned on a 4-byte
boundary, you should stick with 8-byte alignment. 4-byte alignment
carries an 80% performance penalty.
</p><p>
A few nice tricks
</p><p>
When doing graphic-intensive operations in 32-bit mode, you may find some
of these functions useful. They're a collection of tricks to speed up
common blending operations. Have fun decoding them!
</p><p>
The first one blends two RGB values...
</p><p>
The trivial implementation would be :
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="function">calc_blend</code>(<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">color1</code>, <span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">color2</code>)
{
  <span class="type">ulong</span>  <code class="varname">result</code>;

  <code class="varname">result</code> = ((1 + ((<code class="parameter">color1</code> &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xff) + ((<code class="parameter">color2</code> &gt;&gt; 24)
             &amp; 0xff)) &gt;&gt; 1) &lt;&lt; 24;
  <code class="varname">result</code> |= ((1 + ((<code class="parameter">color1</code> &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff) + ((<code class="parameter">color2</code> &gt;&gt; 16)
             &amp; 0xff)) &gt;&gt; 1) &lt;&lt; 16;
  <code class="varname">result</code> |= ((1 + ((<code class="parameter">color1</code> &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff) + ((<code class="parameter">color2</code> &gt;&gt; 8)
             &amp; 0xff)) &gt;&gt; 1) &lt;&lt; 8;
  <code class="varname">result</code> |= ((1 + ((<code class="parameter">color1</code>   ) &amp; 0xff) + ((<code class="parameter">color2</code>   )
             &amp; 0xff)) &gt;&gt; 1);

  return <code class="varname">result</code>;
}
</pre><p>
The fast version is:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="function">calc_blend</code>(<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">color1</code>, <span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">color2</code>)
{
  return ((<code class="parameter">color1</code> &amp; 0xFEFEFEFE)&gt;&gt;1)+
         ((<code class="parameter">color2</code> &amp; 0xFEFEFEFE)&gt;&gt;1)+
          (<code class="parameter">color1</code> &amp; <code class="parameter">color2</code> &amp; 0x01010101L));
}
</pre><p>
A fast color addition with clipping to 0xff:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="function">calc_add</code>(<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">c1</code>, <span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">c2</code>)
{
  return ((((((<code class="parameter">c1</code>^<code class="parameter">c2</code>)&gt;&gt;1)^((<code class="parameter">c1</code>&gt;&gt;1)+
              (<code class="parameter">c2</code>&gt;&gt;1))) &amp; 0x80808080L)&gt;&gt;7)*0xFF)|(<code class="parameter">c1</code>+<code class="parameter">c2</code>);
}
</pre><p>
Now subtraction:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="function">calc_sub</code>(<span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">c1</code>, <span class="type">ulong</span> <code class="parameter">c2</code>)
{
  <code class="parameter">c2</code> ^= 0xFFFFFFFFL;
  return ((((((<code class="parameter">c1</code>^<code class="parameter">c2</code>)&gt;&gt;1)^((<code class="parameter">c1</code>&gt;&gt;1)+(<code class="parameter">c2</code>&gt;&gt;1))) &amp;
               0x80808080L)&gt;&gt;7)*0xFF) &amp; (<code class="parameter">c1</code>+<code class="parameter">c2</code>+1);
}
</pre><p>
By the way, thanks to Pierre for some of these tricks!

You know how you read magazine articles that start, "By the time you read
this..."
</p><p>
Well, it's Thursday before our developer's conference and I'm sitting
here making up things that will sound OK by the time you read this next
week. How about starting with things we do know.
</p><p>
We now have accelerated 3D support for OpenGL®!! How the heck? Well,
start with the Diamond Monster3D board, add the current 2.4 glide library
support from 3Dfx, and mash on the freely available Mesa OpenGL®
implementation, and there you have it. I'm telling you, you have done 3D
until you've done 3D with a nice cheap hardware accelerator.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/glide.zip
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/dr9/samples/mesafx.zip
</p><p>
This will work with any of the 3Dfx Voodoo based graphics cards, not
Voodoo Rush at the moment. Go buy one of these cards (~$200), plug it
into your Mac, and have at it. If you are at the developer's conference,
you'll see this in action, if not, you'll just have to wait.
</p><p>
Speaking of the conference, what else will you see? Well, since you won't
see this until next week anyway, you'll see a whole bunch of other nifty
graphics stuff, as well as a glimpse of what I fondly call WetTV. Not to
dwell on my favorite Bt848 subject, but I'm programming and I can't
stop!! Have you ever watched television where channel changes have movie
transitions? You will need a towel to run this application because after
you do, you will find that you have peed your pants with excitement. Bold
statements? Yes of course, this stuff is kicking and you won't see it on
XYZ operating systems because those programmers simply aren't as
motivated. They're too busy poo pooing how little chance we have of
succeeding.
</p><p>
My brother has this favorite little statement, "We're going to go eat
from the big dog's bowl while he's not looking."
</p><p>
So here we are. Some software available. Some interesting hardware
support, including a new processor, and hungry agile programmers who are
willing to take advantage of superior technology. Thanks for all your
support.
</p><p>
So what kind of support do you get from us? Let me tell you a story. We
were at the local sandwich shop waiting for our food. Geoff had just come
from the local hardware store where he had bought some stain or some
such. He was trying to balance the can on his head, but lacking enough
hair, it didn't stay too well and ended up on the floor. Boy that stuff
spreads fast!! He and one of the other customers quickly mopped it up
while Brian and I quickly got our food and distanced ourselves from the
scene. To redeem himself, he did the 3Dfx support.
</p><p>
That's the kind of tech support personnel we have around here! A little
fool hardy, but we can program up a storm when the need arises. I hope
you all benefit from the fruits of our labors.

Six months ago, we exited the hardware business. We loved our BeBox very
much, but we love to create opportunities for BeOS developers even more.
Our software running on Power Mac compatibles was warmly received. As a
result, BeOS developers could see a much broader installed base than the
one provided by BeBoxen. Apple, Power Computing, Motorola and Umax were
very helpful in making this possible.
</p><p>
Once it became clear we were in the business of adding value to popular
hardware, the next logical step didn't require much thought. We claimed
and proved the portability of our OS; porting it to Intel Architecture
systems made sense. At a time when our engineering resources were
stretched by our work on the major improvements in the Preview Release,
Intel helped us to get started by providing engineers who, for a while,
came to work in our cramped cubicles. Their contribution to this
important project is gratefully acknowledged: We wouldn't be this far
along without their excellent work.
</p><p>
Now, such a move raises many new questions. I'll answer a few today,
leaving the rest to other columns—or BeWeek columnists.
</p><p>
First, does this put us more squarely in competition with Microsoft? In
other words, are we even crazier than previously perceived?
</p><p>
Crazy, perhaps, but not suicidal. Actually, as one of our co-founders,
Steve Sakoman, remarks, one must be crazy to do something original, as
opposed to derivative. But not all craziness is productive. What do we
have to gain by competing more directly with Microsoft?
</p><p>
Let's start by noting that, more and more, when you write a line of C++,
or Java code, you could be competing with Microsoft, whose strategy could
be summarized by one word: Everything.
</p><p>
But universality has its drawbacks. Windows 95 is an excellent general
purpose desktop OS. Windows NT is a holy terror in the enterprise market.
Are we going to be flattened by these two steamrollers? For us, the idea
is to exist to the left or right of them, not in their path. Put another
way, our focus is the digital media content creation space.
</p><p>
The situation opposes a dedicated tool, the BeOS, versus respected
general purpose platforms. Some developers and users will prefer the
benefits of specialization, others will pick the general purpose
platform. Historically, this leads to 75-25%, or 80-20% situations.
</p><p>
Let's continue by noting many advanced PC users already run more than one
OS. Popular software tools called boot managers provide for such
coexistence: Windows NT offers its own, there is the extremely successful
System Commander and Lilo, a very nice Linux utility. We're proud of our
work, we see incredible potential in our OS, but the logical consequence
of specialization is coexistence with general purpose products, as
opposed to attempting to displace them with a (yet) unproven OS such as
ours.
</p><p>
Second, does this mean we are abandoning the PowerPC? Again, no. Why
should we do this at the very moment our OS could run on most personal
computers? As we have said in the past, we are processor agnostic.
</p><p>
Agnostic, and hopeful. Comparing the performance between Intel-based PCs
and PowerPC systems, we see unrealized potential in the PowerPC space. In
the Intel market, competitive forces have honed many parts of the system,
chip sets, bus, memory, disks, graphic accelerators...
</p><p>
As a result, with roughly equivalent Pentium and PowerPC processors,
system performance tends to be superior on the Intel Architecture side.
It's not always pretty, but advances such as USB and FireWire are about
to remove many scars from the past—and it is fast and inexpensive. A
system based on an Intel dual Pentium Pro motherboard, with high-speed
SCSI storage, Ethernet, sound, nice video, etc., can be had for about
$2,500, monitor included.
</p><p>
On the other hand, until recently, the Mac market has been deprived from
the competitive forces which make hardware subsystems more efficient and
less expensive. This is where we see an opportunity for the PowerPC.
There is a chance the much awaited CHRP will finally become a reality. If
it does, an active Mac clone industry will finally actualize the "power"
in PowerPC.
</p><p>
I wrote above we were processor agnostic and hopeful. We aren't blind
either. Apple is still struggling with its licensing dilemma. As everyone
else, I've read the New York Times story reporting Apple Board's
statement to clone makers they were, in essence, no longer wanted. I hope
the NYT was misinformed but I'm struggling with the knowledge John
Markoff, the reporter, is well connected and very careful.
</p><p>
We'll see. In the mean time, we have to take care of our business, which
is to expand opportunities for BeOS developers. That's what we are doing
with the Intel Architecture version.
