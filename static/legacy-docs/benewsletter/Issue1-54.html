</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Engineering1-54"></a>Be Engineering Insights: FCC Wonderland</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Guillaume</span> <span class="surname">Desmarets</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Each profession has a set of criteria by which you can sort good work
from, well... other work. Take software: Most programmers are able to
write a piece of code that will compile (I can do this). Others can track
down the tiniest bug and fix it (I'm borderline, here). And the gods can
get it right the first time while keeping their code clean, small, and
fast (forget it).
</p><p>
Hardware also has its benchmarks. Designing something that can be
manufactured, that won't set your house on fire, and that's cheap is the
hardware Parnassus. Unlike software, however, some of the hardware
criteria are not just advisable—they're legally enforced: If you plan
to sell your product to end users, you first have to get a gold star from
the FCC.
</p><p>
FCC regulations establish physical limits within which your hardware is
supposed to run. Just think about it: What if such rules were applied to
software? What if you programmers had a government agency checking the
quality and compactness of your code? Imagine sitting before a Federal
Software Agency review board to explain why you're polling so much. Or
who want you to translate your comments into an actual human language. Or
who want you to... (Well, maybe I should stop this little fantasy right
here. Just remember: Seg fault and you go to jail.)
</p><p>
Of course, out-of-date comments and lazy error-checking aren't going to
reprogram your VCR or scramble your neighbor's cell-phone call.
</p><p>
One of the most important FCC regulations limits the amount of
electromagnetic noise your computer can produce. All active electronic
equipment produces such noise: Signals propagate through your board,
which acts as an antenna. Some frequency bands—the lowest ones—are
pretty easy to control because they need a big antenna to radiate any
significant amount of energy. But high frequencies are pernicious; they
sneak through any available electrical path, spill out any gap in a
chassis, and spread all over the place. And unfortunately for the
hardware engineer, computer components aren't getting any slower; as CPU
clocks and bus rates get faster, the task of eliminating excess noise
gets tougher.
</p><p>
There are different ways to bring a product within FCC guidelines once
you have a prototype to play with, but nothing replaces good intuition in
the design stage. After you've drawn a (hopefully) noise-free schematic,
you can simulate your hardware in software. Unfortunately, good
simulation tools are expensive and require a lot of time to learn and use.
</p><p>
At some point, you have to put your pencil down and send your schematic
to a fabrication shop (or build it yourself). This, obviously, can be the
most expensive step, and not one you want to have to re-do. When you get
your toy back, it's time for the real test: You have to "scan" your
product for noise.
</p><p>
The process of scanning is quite simple. You reproduce a potential
working environment by plugging devices into each of the I/O ports of the
system you're testing. The <span class="trademark">BeBox</span>™ has 24 connectors, plus the graphic
card, plus the CD headphones... The system has to run software that can
exercise the computer as well as the various external devices (which, to
get a realistic measurement, should be commercially available products).
Then you put the computer on a stand that spins in front of an antenna
that measures the noise. And your humble construction starts to spin...
</p><p>
Have you ever had this dream where you're a kid again, and you've arrived
at school only to realize that you've forgotten to put your clothes on?
</p><p>
When the scan is over and you get the results, in which every
imperfection in your work is magnified, you have the choice of fighting
with the machine to lower the noise (inserting ferrites, playing with the
mess of cables coming out of the box, adding gaskets to the chassis),
going back to the (virtual) drawing board to rework your design—or you
can hit the bars in an attempt to find your pants.
</p><p>
The 133 MHz BeBox complies with the FCC and European class B
requirements; therefore, it can be sold to end users.

Apple's original announcement that they were shopping around for an OS
was the start to an open discussion about Apple's ability to actually
deliver a modern OS. The Copland project has ended with little doubt that
it was a failure. As the January Macworld Expo approaches, so too does
Apple's announcement about its future plans for the MacOS. Considerable
discussion about Apple choices and which OS would be best have taken
place in the trade press, inside software vendors, and in the general
population.
</p><p>
At StarCode, we just want the issue to be settled one way or another. If
the Apple deal goes through, great! We can step up our development
efforts and support a larger team.
</p><p>
Of a great deal more importance to us is to be able to use the BeOS
full-time for all the things that we have come to expect PCs to do. We
don't think we're alone in our desire to have a fast, stable, modern OS
to work and play on. So, in our desire to be good Be citizens, what to do?
</p><p>
Well, the first step is to pick our five favorite apps that we'd like to
see on the BeOS. These could be Photoshop, Eudora, or even Doom. Second,
we must e-mail at least one person at the respective companies, whether
it's the webmaster, or the person who answers info@whatever.com, or the
CEO—it doesn't matter. Third, make sure five friends do this as well
with their favorite apps.
</p><p>
This has probably been the most noble cause ever to mail bomb a company.
If we can get just a thousand Be aficionados to send e-mails by
Christmas, we're guaranteed of changing some companies minds around the
time of Macworld in San Francisco.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id513149"></a>PackageBuilder and Beyond</h3></div></div></div><p>
Our PackageBuilder product will soon be in its third preliminary release.
Aside from the usual bug fixes, this version finally sees the addition of
binary patching capabilities. Following this release, we'll begin
planning for the release of version 1.0, which should be available at
about the same time as DR9 of the BeOS. For file-system intensive
programs like our installer, the changeover to DR9 will likely involve
considerable work. Our hope is that early planning can make this as
smooth a transition as possible, both for us and for developers using our
product.
</p><p>
In addition, with the release of 1.0 we finally hope to have a
preliminary software uninstaller. The uninstaller will capitalize on the
new and improved database, thus providing a quick and foolproof way to
track installed software.
</p><p>
As usual we welcome feedback and product suggestions from fellow users
and developers. The more feedback we see, the better we can make
PackageBuilder 2.0. Additionally, if you have a specific installation
need for your software, we'd love to come up with a speedy and effective
solution for you. Let us know.

StarCode Software will be demoing at Be's booth at Macworld San

(which we demoed at the December developer kitchen), and announcing our
pricing. Come by and see us.

Whooo weee! Time sure does fly when you're having fun! This past year has
been quite an exciting and tumultuous one. Be, Inc. as a company has gone
from obscurity to limelight in a few short months. But all the hoopla
surrounding the BeOS hasn't just been in the applications that we've
shown at demos. Our developers have done quite a fine job of coming up
with real applications for real-world use.
</p><p>
There are a number of notables, and we've highlighted a few in this
newsletter. The bottom line is, you simply must take a look at the Be ftp
site and the BeWare pages to get a good feel for what people have worked
on and will continue to work on in the near future.
</p><p>
For once though, I'm not going to be long winded and give a big long
story about what's gone by. Suffice it to say that a lot of time has
passed, and many good things have been done. As a holiday gift, we have
the source to the Clock application.
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/clock.tgz
</p><p>
This is the last newsletter for the year, but it's not the last time
you'll get sources. There are still a couple more things that will squeak
out before Macworld, so keep an eye on the ftp site. Hopefully we'll be
using this down time to catch up with actual tutorials.
</p><p>
The last Developer's kitchen was well attended, and a few developers were
helped along to finish their efforts. We finished the year with a strong
PowerMac port, and a promising future at Macworld. Speaking of which,
there will be a Be Developer's Conference after the Macworld event on
January 11th at the Hyatt Embarcadero in San Francisco. The general
details are that the event will be held from 10 am to 6 pm or until we
are kicked out. Look for more detailed information on our Web site soon.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id513267"></a>For The Last Time</h3></div></div></div><p>
Since this is the last newsletter of the year, for one last time I want
to say BOOOM BOOOM BOOOM! That's the last thumping of the drum to get
developers to polish up their applications if they want them to be shown
at Macworld on January 7. I'm speaking primarily to the crowd of
developers who will not actually be in attendance, but who want their
applications to be shown in some way. Get them uploaded to the ftp site
as soon as you can, so that we can become familiar enough with them to
show them with pride.
</p><p>
I bought my first BeBox about a year ago. I spent that first holiday
vacation porting as many apps from all over the place as I could. Three
releases of the OS later, I came to realize that I liked what I was
playing with enough to actually join the company that was giving it to
me. I don't regret my decision for a moment, and I'm having the time of
my life in this venture. I hope we're spreading the same amount of
excitement to the rest of our development community.

I wonder if the era of the "free" Internet is coming to an end. For a
couple of decades, the Internet grew in the relative obscurity of a
community of UNIX users in university research laboratories. In the
spirit of academic freedom, most everything was accessible, shared, and
virtually free. For proficient users, the feeling of power and reach was
exhilarating. More than five years ago, companies such as NetCom in San
Jose started selling dial-up Internet access for what passed then for
ridiculously low fixed fees. Mosaic appeared and the Net started to
become accessible to normal, or at least less geeky people. We know what
happened: Tens of millions of people (I leave the exact number to the
professional sages) are now connected, and companies such as America
Online and Compuserve have been forced to drastically alter their
business models—to say nothing of their accounting methodologies.
</p><p>
But now we start hearing a different tune. Users complain about pesky
servers, interrupted connections, slow or frozen downloads, cranky DNS
servers, and the worldwide wait.
</p><p>
In many respects, we found an infrastructure and we clear- cut it. At
least, that's the way the phone companies will describe it. Local calls
are free or almost free. They're subsidized by long distance
conversations. For these the local company gets an access fee, a cut of
the long distance toll paid by the user to AT&amp;T, MCI, and their
competitors. Voice calls are measured in minutes, not hours. Now comes
the friendly neighborhood ISP. The call to the access point is a local
one, and once you hop on the Net, there's no more long distance toll
rebated to the local phone companies. The Internet calls measure in
hours, not minutes, and eat capacity at the local phone company. The
development of the Net forces these companies to bring profit-free new
capacity on line. Whatever we otherwise think of the phone companies, if
they install another line at your home because you spend hours on the
Web, they'll not get the same return for their investment. They feel ISPs
and Net users have clear-cut the infrastructure without providing funds
for replanting.
</p><p>
Turning to the potential for highly interactive, high- bandwidth
multimedia on the Net, we must underline the word potential. Nowhere is
the infrastructure capable of sustaining the peak bandwidth these data
types require. What about the cable network and cable modems? This is
another case of a tired infrastructure stretched well beyond its carrying
capacity. It's so easy to add new users, new taps on a cable, at least in
the theory of a broadcast model. We know what consumers think of the
signal quality and service "enjoyed" on cable. When asked what he thought
of the competition that cable operators might create for the local phone
companies, one executive asked in return: "Would you trust these guys to
carry your 911 call?" And in addition to the problematic quality of
today's cable infrastructure, clear-cut as it is already, the Internet
with all its problems still lies beyond the head end of the cable system.
</p><p>
Back to the Net, then. If the potential is to become reality, someone
will have to pay for replanting, for creating more carrying capacity, or
the navigators will discover that the trees have run out. Who will pay to
create new capacity? Users, advertisers, content providers, the taxpayer?
Are we going to have several classes of service for IP packets, as we
have for letters and parcels? I hope the answer to the latter question is
yes, so taxpayers don't have to pay for services they may or may not use.
It might be feasible. After all, this is the country where the Postal
Service seems to balance its budget. Let's hope the IP Service does the
same for basic net services and that we'll see a range of faster IP
courier services emerge as well.

More discussion of threads, semaphores, and (somehow) sockets. The
primary topic was the efficiency of semaphores (which, in this debate,
means multithreadedness) in the light of the context-switch overhead:
At what point does multithreading lose its appeal because of the
overhead incurred by hitting the controlling semaphores? No clear
answers, here, but some numbers were thrown around.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id513398"></a>Subject: Preferences and version numbers</h4></div></div></div><p>
Where should version information go, and how should it be accessed? Is
a binary version (of the version) necessary so installation tools can
operate properly? Also, what do you have to do to satisfy copyright
requirements? According to one of our listeners, copyright info must be
presented to the user when the app is launched, and a human-readable
(and so hexdump-displayable) version must be embedded in the binary.
But is this so? Another listener claimed that the "must be presented to
the user" rule refers to license agreements, not copyrights.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id513411"></a>WEEK 2</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id513417"></a>Subject: Accessing Preferences</h4></div></div></div><p>
More talk about where preferences info should be stored in a multi-user
system. Various existing methods were described and considered (but
mostly dismissed). The database as a compendium of preference values
keyed to individual users is the popular choice, although there are
still some "preference directory" holdouts.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id513434"></a>Subject: BWindowScreen</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">AKA: Multiple Monitors</h5></div></div></div><p>
This thread became a discussion of multiple displays. The app server
doesn't support multiple heads yet, but once it does, how should they
be used? Should each monitor be a separate workspace? There was some
speculation that splitting a single workspace over multiple displays
would be inefficient. Others argued that you could (theoretically)
split a single window between monitors with no significant overhead, so
one-monitor/one-workspace isn't a necessary restriction.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Note that you *can* plug in multiple gfx cards and
monitors to develop a video driver, but the app server will only talk
to the first card that it finds. For more info on video driver
development, see William Adams' column in last week's Newsletter (#53).

An initial query, "why is there a mail_daemon?" elicited a number of
quick (and well-tuned) responses: So you can easily plug in your own
mail application. As Jake Hamby put it:
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">With mail_daemon, I just make the BMailMessage and then it takes on
whatever user prefs have been set: connection frequency, POP/SMTP
options, whatever. And as Jon Ragnarsson commented, it was
frighteningly simple.</span>”
</p><p>
This led some readers to ask for even more "pluggable" servers, for
http, sockets, ftp, etc.

What's the best way to handle hundreds of messages a second? Can the

THE BE LINE: (from Dominic Giampaolo) “<span class="quote">I believe we can send around
7,000 or so 64 byte messages per second on a 66 MHz BeBox and even more
on the 133s. Try to make your messages a power of 2 in size: It's
actually faster to send 64 bytes than to send 62.</span>” (Dominic off)

The kernel indeed uses ports, which are faster than the current
suspicion.
