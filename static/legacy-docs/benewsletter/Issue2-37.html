One of the new features in the Preview Release is the software MIDI
synthesizer. The Midi Kit contains three classes for controlling the MIDI
synthesizer: <code class="classname">BSynth</code>, <code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code>,
and <code class="classname">BMidiSynthFile</code>. The <code class="classname">BSynth</code> object is
the interface to the underlying synthesizer engine. <code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code> is a
subclass of BMidi that forwards MIDI events to the <code class="classname">BSynth</code> object. And
<code class="classname">BMidiSynthFile</code> is a specialization of
<code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code> which reads from a
standard MIDI file.
</p><p>
An application that uses the MIDI synthesizer starts by creating a <code class="classname">BSynth</code>
object. Currently you can only create one <code class="classname">BSynth</code> object per application,
but you probably only need one anyway. After creating the <code class="classname">BSynth</code>, call
<code class="methodname">LoadSynthData</code>(<code class="constant">B_BIG_SYNTH</code>)
on it. This tells the <code class="classname">BSynth</code> to use the
instrument file
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/etc/synth/big_synth.sy</code>.
</p><p>
If the call to <code class="methodname">LoadSynthData()</code> fails, it probably couldn't find the
instrument file. <code class="methodname">LoadSynthData()</code> does not load the instruments into
memory yet. Unless you are playing directly from a MIDI file you will
still need to load the instruments.
</p><p>
The application then creates a <code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code> object which you can send MIDI
events to just as you would to any other <code class="classname">BMidi</code> object. After creating the
<code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code>, call <code class="methodname">EnableInput()</code>
on it. The first argument to <code class="methodname">EnableInput()</code>
should be true, and the second argument indicates whether to pre-load all
instruments from the instrument file.
</p><p>
The easiest way to see how this works is to try it. Here is a program
that plays six notes on a piano. Don't forget to link with
<code class="filename">libmidi.so</code>.
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;MidiSynth.h&gt;

<code class="function">main</code> ()
{
  <code class="classname">BSynth</code> <code class="varname">synth</code>;
  <span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">synth</code>.<code class="methodname">LoadSynthData</code>(<code class="constant">B_BIG_SYNTH</code>);
  if (<code class="varname">err</code>) {
    <code class="function">printf</code> ("LoadSynthData: %x\n", <code class="varname">err</code>);
    return -1;
  }

  <code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code> <code class="varname">song</code>;
  <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">EnableInput</code>(<code class="constant">true</code>, <code class="constant">false</code>);
  if (<code class="varname">err</code>) {
    <code class="function">printf</code> ("EnableInput: %x\n", <code class="varname">err</code>);
    return -1;
  }

  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">channel</code> = 1;       <span class="comment">// MIDI channel number</span>
  <span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">instrument</code> = <code class="constant">B_ACOUSTIC_GRAND</code>; <span class="comment">// GM instrument</span>
  <code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">LoadInstrument</code>(<code class="varname">instrument</code>);
  <code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">ProgramChange</code>(<code class="varname">channel</code>, <code class="varname">instrument</code>);

  for (<span class="type">int</span> <code class="varname">i</code> = 0; <code class="varname">i</code> &lt; 6; <code class="varname">i</code>++) {
    <code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">NoteOn</code>(<code class="varname">channel</code>, 60 + 5 * <code class="varname">i</code>, 127);
    <code class="function">snooze</code>(250000);
  }

  <code class="function">snooze</code>(2000000);
  <code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">AllNotesOff</code>(<code class="constant">FALSE</code>);
  return 0;
}
</pre><p>
In this example <code class="varname">channel</code> is a MIDI channel number (1-16), and
<code class="varname">instrument</code> is a General MIDI instrument number. The instrument numbers
are represented by the <span class="type">midi_axe</span> constants defined in
<code class="filename">MidiDefs.h</code>. The
<code class="methodname">ProgramChange()</code> call associates an instrument with a channel.
</p><p>
You can also play the synthesizer from an external MIDI keyboard. If you
are on a Mac you will also need a Mac MIDI interface (I'm using an
"Opcode Midi Translator II"). To do this, you just connect a <code class="classname">BMidiPort</code> to
the <code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BSynth</code> <code class="varname">synth</code>;
<code class="varname">synth</code>.<code class="methodname">LoadSynthData</code>(<code class="constant">B_BIG_SYNTH</code>);

<code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code> <code class="varname">song</code>;
<code class="function">printf</code>("Loading instruments...\n");
<code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">EnableInput</code>(<code class="constant">true</code>, <code class="constant">true</code>);
<code class="function">printf</code>("Done.\n");

<code class="classname">BMidiPort</code> <code class="varname">port</code>;
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">port</code>.<code class="methodname">Open</code>("midi2"); <span class="comment">// printer port on Macs</span>
if (<code class="varname">err</code>)
  <code class="function">printf</code> ("Open: %x\n", <code class="varname">err</code>);
<code class="varname">port</code>.<code class="methodname">Connect</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">song</code>);
<code class="varname">port</code>.<code class="methodname">Start</code>();
</pre><p>
In this case the second argument to <code class="methodname">EnableInput()</code>
is <code class="constant">true</code>. So all the
instruments will be pre-loaded, which may take a few seconds. Note that
on Macs, "midi1" is the modem port and "midi2" is the printer port.
</p><p>
To play a MIDI file, use a <code class="classname">BMidiSynthFile</code> instead of a <code class="classname">BMidiSynth</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;MidiSynthFile.h&gt;

<code class="function">main</code> ()
{
  <code class="classname">BSynth</code> <code class="varname">synth</code>;
  <code class="varname">synth</code>.<code class="methodname">LoadSynthData</code>(<code class="constant">B_BIG_SYNTH</code>);

  <span class="type">char*</span> <code class="varname">filename</code> = "/boot/optional/midi/BeBoxBeBop.mid";
  <code class="classname">BMidiSynthFile</code> <code class="varname">song</code>;
  <span class="type">entry_ref</span> <code class="varname">ref</code>;
  <code class="function">get_ref_for_path</code>(<code class="varname">filename</code>, &amp;<code class="varname">ref</code>);
  <span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">err</code> = <code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">LoadFile</code>(&amp;<code class="varname">ref</code>);
  if (<code class="varname">err</code>) {
    <code class="function">printf</code> ("LoadFile: can't open %s\n", <code class="varname">filename</code>);
    return -1;
  }

  <code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">Start</code>();
  while (!<code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">IsFinished</code>())
    <code class="function">snooze</code>(1000000);
  <code class="varname">song</code>.<code class="methodname">Fade</code>();
  return 0;
}
</pre><p>
There are also several other <code class="classname">BSynth</code> methods
such as <code class="methodname">SetReverb()</code> and
<code class="methodname">SetSynthVolume()</code> to experiment with, but this is enough to get started
using the <code class="classname">BSynth</code>. So dig out those old MIDI keyboards and plug them in!

Tonight she told me that it turned out to be a problem with Extensions.
Imagine that. A problem with Extensions. You could almost write a

Wow. Thanks, Jake.<br />
And ya know?<br />
He plays a mean ocarina. =)
</p><p>
Driving up to the Avenues the other night, I was telling Jake that it's
really the people at Be who have allowed us to develop at such a rapid
rate. It has been the inter-linking of so many different personalities,
of so many different work styles: so many concessions and acknowledgments
made in the name of The Right Way. It's quite simple, and yet,
terrifically effective. We joked with abstraction about the
BeActionPlaySet, plastic StarWars-size BePlay figures of Dominic, and
Benoit, and George. And we considered, with respect, how many more of
each individual engineer Be would need to cover perfectly the near-future
work to be done. As for testing, I think just one each of Ming and Mel
and Jake and I could handle it. Well, maybe two Mings. One for each wing.
=) We'll definitely need more space though.
</p><p>
And so the fourth floor acquisition is but one release away (gotta put
those engineers somewhere). MIA and CBS and DVD and I'm a little worried
that we will grow too fast. That there will be so much to do that we
won't have time to find out who our co-workers are. What they love and
dislike. What they have seen. Where they have been. Hmmm. Perhaps this is
an attempt to jinx us. Keep the lid on our secret a little longer. Let
this GUI simmer in these, the last of our simple days.

Are you AllAttached? When you're using a programming framework, sometimes
it takes a while to figure out all the ins and outs of what happens when.
The BeOS programming interface is clean and simple to use, but learning a
little bit about proper usage can go a long way. I was recently playing
with a library of code which was largely unknown to me, when my
application kept crashing on initialization. It turns out that I was
trying to set a target handler for a object that didn't quite exist yet.
Specifically it was a button in one of the views that is not created
until the <code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code> method is called.
</p><p>
Well, <code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code> gets called when you actually add a view to a
window's hierarchy. At this point, you can call the <code class="methodname">Window()</code> method of a
view to get a pointer to the window you're attached to. Also, at this
point none of your child view's <code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code> methods will have been
called, and you know nothing about your sibling views. So what's safe to
do here? Things that are directly related to your view that you didn't
already do in your constructor. You might add child views, set your font
and colors and all that.
</p><p>
What about <code class="methodname">AllAttached()</code>? You want to use this when it is absolutely
paramount that all of your child views have been attached. This would be
the case if you are going to perform an action that depends on the
existence of your child views in the hierarchy.
</p><p>
So let's say there should be a button in your view with the name "OK".
And you want to set the target handler of that button to be yourself.
Ideally you want to do the following:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<span class="type"><code class="classname">BButton</code> *</span><code class="varname">aButton</code> = (<span class="type"><code class="classname">BButton</code> *</span>)<code class="methodname">FindView</code>("OK");
if (0 != <code class="varname">aButton</code>)
  <code class="varname">aButton</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">SetTarget</code>(<code class="varname">this</code>);
</pre><p>
Where is it safe to put this code? Well, if you were the view writer and
you know explicitly when the button was created, then you can do it
anywhere you want. If you are sub-classing some other view, then it's
safest to stick the code in the <code class="methodname">AllAttached()</code> method, assuming that the
original view author created the button in their <code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code>
method.
</p><p>
This is what I did, and my bugs went away. Just goes to show you...
</p><p>
Then I got to figuring, there's got to be more uses of <code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code>s.
So I sought to simplify the HelloWorld application. Often times when you
create a simple little app, you might create a sub-class of <code class="classname">BApplication</code>
and <code class="classname">BWindow</code>, simply to implement the
<code class="classname">BWindow</code>::<code class="methodname">QuitRequested()</code> method so
when the window closes, the app will quit. Well, that seems like a bit
much just to quit an app, how about a filter?
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
#include &lt;MessageFilter.h&gt;
#include &lt;Application.h&gt;
#include &lt;Window.h&gt;

static <span class="type">filter_result</span>
<code class="function">QuitFilter</code>(<span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessage</code> *</span><code class="parameter">msg</code>, <span class="type"><code class="classname">BHandler</code> **</span><code class="parameter">target</code>,
           <span class="type"><code class="classname">BMessageFilter</code> *</span><code class="parameter">filter</code>)
{
  <code class="varname">be_app</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">PostMessage</code>(<code class="constant">B_QUIT_REQUESTED</code>);
  return <code class="constant">B_SKIP_MESSAGE</code>;
}
</pre><p>
In this case, whenever this filter receives a message, it will post a
message to the application object asking it to quit. You could have
actually checked the <code class="code">*msg</code> passed in to make sure what type of message it
is, but in this very simple case we don't care. As you will see below,
the filter is installed in such a way that only one type of message will
come to this filter in the first place.
</p><p>
So, now my simple application to pop a window up on the screen and quit
when it's closed looks like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="varname">gWindowSize</code> = <code class="classname">BRect</code>(100,80,260,120);

This is a very simple app. All it needs is a specialized view to be added
to the window and you're all set. You can use this as a template for
knocking out those quick and dirty apps where you just want to try
something out in a window real quick.
</p><p>
If all your view does is draw something, you could conceivably create a
simple base class view that you could install a drawing function into. It
would then in turn call this drawing function whenever the Draw() method
was called.
</p><p>
Fun things can be done with this. If you haven't already started playing
with filters, then maybe this gives you some incentive. They really are
flexible and allow you to quickly and dynamically change the nature of
your application simply by installing and removing filters.
</p><p>
How can filters be used for an interface builder? Maybe that's what
someone can do next?

CHRP had the right goal: To create a hardware standard around the PowerPC
similar in intent to what IBM's PC/AT became for the Intel processor, the
core platform around which a huge industry was built. Almost forgotten is
that while IBM designed the PC/AT, it lost control of the standard. It
was IBM's very loss of control that gave birth to the clone industry, now
driven, if not controlled, by Intel and Microsoft.
</p><p>
This bit of history isn't lost on Apple's management. They remember IBM's
futile attempt to regain control of the PC standard with the proprietary
PS/2 platform and have concluded that even with a hypothetical "private"
version of CHRP, they would lose the hardware battle. In many respects,
CHRP would have been a bigger danger to Apple than Power Computing ever
was: Power's engineers were industrious and talented—had CHRP lived,
industry and talent wouldn't have been necessary. Lower the bar and
increase the competition.
</p><p>
Regardless of what we think of Apple's decision to bring the Mac cloning
experiment to an end, the demise of CHRP is a logical consequence of the
de-cloning move. Yet, many have stated their opinion that there is life
left in CHRP—potentially. As a result, we've seen several suggestions
on the 'Net with a view to breathing commercial life back into an
"independent" PowerPC platform.
</p><p>
These observers go on to suggest there must be a considerable inventory
of CHRP systems or, if not systems, ready-to-assemble components
otherwise condemned to the scrap heap. The performance of CHRP hardware
demonstrated by Motorola and IBM is enticing; why not use
cost-competitive, if not "devalued" CHRP hardware to build a BeOS-based
"Photoshop box"?
</p><p>
This is an engaging suggestion, and the thought experiment it triggers
will allows us to explore issues such as dedicated systems vs. general
purpose ones, the cost and performance benefits of the BeOS for a given
application space and porting existing applications vs. enabling new ones.
</p><p>
If I follow the dominoes correctly, Photoshop has a large user base,
these users are hungry for performance, or cost savings, or both, and
many would buy one or more additional "boxes" just to run Photoshop if
they saw enough productivity gains in a dedicated machine. A dual
processor CHRP system just running a BeOS version of Photoshop would
excite a large enough user population to incite one or more hardware
manufacturers to ship such a product. In turn, this would constitute a
sizeable enough business to trigger Adobe into making Photoshop available
for this system.
</p><p>
This, needless to say, is purely hypothetical and I don't want to imply
that any of the companies mentioned or alluded to have expressed the
slightest shadow of interest for the idea. This is purely a thought
experiment.
</p><p>
Even with this stipulation, I won't speculate too much as to why Adobe
would or wouldn't consider such an idea. Performance is always welcome by
Photoshop users and we've demonstrated substantial improvements on
existing hardware as well as on affordable multi-processor systems.
</p><p>
Still, if I dare to imagine Adobe's concerns, there must be the cost of
producing a new version of Photoshop and there must be the alternative of
the Intel space. In the latter, there is inexpensive dual-processor
hardware and interesting performance improvements in the making. I don't
know what would happen if Adobe would let it be known they'd support the
concept of a dedicated Photoshop system. Where would the best bids come
from?
</p><p>
In the past, dedicated systems haven't fared too well. Take the word
processor. In the early difficult days of the Mac, many observers
remarked on the ease of use and beautiful printing obtained with
MacWrite. They concluded the Mac should be reconfigured as a dedicated
word processor. That didn't happen. Does this apply to the current idea?
On the one hand customers have shown a liking for a system with a wide
range of actual or potential uses. On the other hand, word processing
applications are not driven by the thirst for performance Photoshop users
experience.
</p><p>
Addressing cost, using the BeOS in a dedicated configuration might do
more than add performance. Using the modularity of the BeOS and targeting
Photoshop users could further reduce the footprint of the system and thus
save hardware dollars. Still, others will remind us that hardware ought
to stay as close as possible to the mainstream in order to best capture
the benefits of competition between vendors.
</p><p>
Lastly, there is the question of new software versus mature applications.
On this issue, the assumptions of today's thought experiment matter a
great deal. Historically, ports from one generation of operating systems
to a new one don't do well. The reasons might be that the technical
constraints of the old design don't permit effective use of the new
platform, or it could be that the press of business on the existing front
leaves no financial or psychic energy for a risky bet on a new vehicle.
(DOS to Windows, or Apple II to Mac are changes of generation; Mac to
Windows isn't; Mac or Windows to the BeOS are.)
</p><p>
What differs in today's thought experiment is the assumption that a
dedicated box would be sold almost exclusively to existing Photoshop
users who want the simplest, least disruptive, most effective way of
improving their existing work flow. In such a context a port could do
very well.
</p><p>
It is too early to tell if the many suggestions we've seen on the 'Net
for a "Photoshop box" will lead to an actual implementation, but we
certainly appreciate the positive sentiments they convey.
