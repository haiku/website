With the Preview Release CD out in the hands of developers and users,
BeOS developers can finally ship their software to paying customers.
Several developers have wanted to ship their products on CD, and in the
process came up with several questions regarding how to make a BeOS (Be
File System, or BFS) CD. To answer some of those questions, I have put
together a short reference to the process we use here at Be.
</p><p>
There are many ways to accomplish the same results that I talk about,
with different software, hardware, etc. The examples I give are ones
which I know work, and are actually in use here at Be.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id581275"></a>What do I need to make a CD?</h3></div></div></div><p>
From a hardware standpoint, you will minimally need a Macintosh or a PC
with a CD-ROM burner attach to it, a CD mastering hard disk, and a BeBox
or Macintosh running the BeOS. You can use the machine that is attached
to the CD-ROM burner as the BeOS machine if it is one of the Power Macs
that is supported by the BeOS.
</p><p>
There are several CD-ROM mastering packages available on the market. At
the present time, because none of the packages understand the BFS format,
the key feature that you need to master a BeOS CD is software that can
support making a direct copy of a hard drive. We need this feature
because we want an exact copy of our master hard disk, without the
mastering software trying to interpret the (unknown) BeOS format.
</p><p>
Another feature that is good to have is functionality that allows you to
specify the end point of the copy in either blocks or megabytes. This
will give you more flexibility in the size of the hard drive you can use
to master the CD. You can choose to use any large hard drive (although
there are some tricky calculations involved).
</p><p>
At Be, we use the Astarte Toast CD-ROM Pro 3 software for the Macintosh.
Astarte Toast software has both of these features. Several companies make
good CD-ROM mastering hardware. The one we use at Be is the Yamaha
CDR-100. It is a 4x reader and writer, and is supported by the Astarte
Toast software.
</p><p>
Our primary CD mastering station is a PowerCenter 132 with a Yamaha
CDR-100 and some old open-faced HD-20 cases used primarily for ease in
attaching other hard disks to the system for toasting.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id581327"></a>Multisession versus multi-partition CDs</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you need to have a CD with more than one partition on it, you have two
choices. You can create a CD with multiple partitions or you can create a
multisession CD. Which is better? It all depends on what you want to do.
</p><p>
The multisession CD is easier to create and you have more flexibility on
each of the sessions. You also don't have to record all of the sessions
at the same time.
</p><p>
But there are several drawbacks. One is that you won't be able to simply
make a copy of the CD on your personal mastering system. To make a second
CD you will have to go through the entire process of burning each of the
sessions individually. But possibly the biggest problem with multisession
CDs is that not all of the duplicating houses know how to duplicate a Mac
OS/BeOS multisession CD. We had many problems with different vendors in
the process of duplicating our BeOS DR8 CDs.
</p><p>
Another problem we noticed with multisession CDs is that if the sessions
are not mastered in the correct order, they may not show up on some Power
Macs. The situation where we know this will happen is if you burn a Mac
OS/BeOS multisession CD and put the BeOS session first and the Mac OS
session second. The Mac OS session will not show up on Power Computing
systems (and possibly others), because the standard CD-ROM Toolkit that
is shipped with all Power Computing machines by default mounts only the
first session of a multisession CD-ROM.
</p><p>
The CD-ROM Toolkit tries to mount the BeOS session and fails, but it does
not then look for any other sessions on the CD. Since this is the default
behavior of the CD-ROM Toolkit software, some Macintosh users will never
know that there is a Mac OS session on the CD.
</p><p>
A multiple partition CD is a bit more work to create but you will not
have the problems you can have with a multisession CD. Some of the extra
work is in creating the partitions. It is even more work if you want a
Mac OS partition for one partition and a BeOS partition for another. The
extra work involved in creating the multiple partitions is done on the
Mac with a Mac hard disk partitioning utility. The one we use here at Be
is the HDT Primer, part of FWB's Hard Disk Toolkit, which ships with
Power Computing systems.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id581375"></a>BFS CDs versus other CD formats</h3></div></div></div><p>
If you have mastered a Macintosh, PC, or ISO9660 CD-ROM, then making a
BeOS CD will be very similar. Since there is currently no mastering
software that runs natively on the BeOS or understands the BFS format,
there is no way to take advantage of features present in the mastering
software which assume the CD is destined for a Mac or PC. These features
let you do some things very useful to the mastering process, such as not
copying the empty area of the master hard drive onto the CD, or creating
a new CD volume on the fly without using a master hard disk.
</p><p>
To get around the lack of these features, we need to use a physical hard
disk that we can format on the BeOS, and then build the master of the CD
on the hard drive under BeOS (and the Mac OS, if there will be a Mac OS
partition). Then, since the software does not understand the BFS format,
to burn the CD we have to do a blind SCSI volume copy of the hard disk to
the CD.
</p><p>
In order to do a blind copy, though, we need a hard disk that is big
enough to hold all of our data but is smaller than the size of a CD
(which is 650 megabytes); otherwise the copy will overrun the end of the
CD. Finding a disk that is smaller than 650 megabytes today can be a
challenge! But if all of your data is less than 100 megabytes then you
can use a Zip disk as the mastering disk.
</p><p>
But the most important thing to know is that when you initialize the
master hard disk, you must set the File System Block Size to 2048 or 4096
bytes. This is easy to forget because when you initialize a Be File
System, the default is 1024 bytes.
</p><p>
This has bitten both Robert Polic, the author of DriveSetup, and I
several times. The reason is that if you forget to set the Block Size to
2048, you will not get any warning (1024 byte blocks are fine for normal
BeOS volumes) and everything will work normally on the master hard disk.
</p><p>
But, once you master the CD, you will find that the CD will not mount
under the BeOS. The reason is that the Be File System will not recognize
block sizes smaller than the device's minimum block size, which on a
CD-ROM is 2048 bytes.
</p><p>
There is nothing you can do at that point, and the hours spent copying,
laying out, and mimesetting the disk are all for naught. The only thing
to do is to take a deep breath and start all over again, *this time*
initializing the disk with the block size set to 2048...
</p><p>
The following are two examples of the process to follow to master a BeOS
CD. It is a very high level guide for mastering the CD, and many of the
details are left out. If you need detailed instructions, let me know.
</p><p>
The hardware and software requirements are based on our setup here at Be.
You can replace them with the hardware and software available at your
site.

How many BeOS demos have you attended? I know I've seen a few. BeOS demo
tours serve many purposes. There's the obvious: Get end-users excited
about the performance that's hiding inside their Power Macintosh
computers, such that they wish to run the BeOS and purchase third party
software for it. And the not so obvious: Get those software developers
that are hiding in the crowd excited about the new development
possibilities that such a powerful operating system allows, such that
they write applications for the BeOS.
</p><p>
We spend long hours preparing demos, especially those large demo
sequences we go through at MacWorld. The point is, a great demo can serve
you well. Since the BeOS is moving into a phase in which we're starting
to see some really great commercial applications being delivered to
market, I thought I'd write an article that may help your demo (of your
application, not just the BeOS) serve you well.
</p><p>
Over the past year I've been compiling mental "keep in mind" notes about
demos. I thought I'd share these with our developers, many of whom are
now entering that phase where they need to start showing off their
software. I'll start with the obvious and work towards the weird.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
Know your material.
</p><p>
Probably good advice for anything in life, especially when you are
giving a presentation of any kind. If you know your material inside
and out, you'll have more fun telling someone else about it.
</p></li><li><p>
Be nervous.
</p><p>
Anybody doing public speaking who isn't nervous is either dead or
speaking to an empty auditorium. Trust me, you're going to be nervous.
I've done hundreds of demos and I still get nervous. This is a classic
example of BO. No, not Body Odor, but Burden and Opportunity. If
you've handled point #1 appropriately, then this is your Opportunity
to show off what you know. Your nervousness is just you getting pumped
to deliver. Don't sweat it because once you get rolling, the
butterflies will have migrated elsewhere.
</p></li><li><p>
Pre-stage and bring your own demo equipment.
</p><p>
Give your demo on a known system that you've set up in advance. Try
not to bring software with you to install on someone else's system. If
you really have to do this, set up the night before and expect to find
something that you've never seen before ("Wow, you've got a hardware
interface controlling the entire building's security system here. Mind
if I disconnect it for awhile?).
</p></li><li><p>
Hard drives die.
</p><p>
Bring an extra hard drive, hopefully identical to the one in the
machine already. What can break, will break, although there are limits
to just how much spare equipment you can bring. Or live dangerously
(I've seen good body impressions of Pulse and the 3D Book demos).
</p></li><li><p>
Know your software's strengths and show them off.
</p><p>
Software is always changing. Features are added, speed optimized,
interfaces refined. Know your current strengths and show them off. In
fact, I've found that giving concrete examples of why a particular
feature might be useful helps the crowd put concepts in context.
</p><p>
Two simple examples from the BeOS demo. One, when I show FontDemo and
the real-time scaling of fonts, I use Photoshop's dialog boxes
interface as a contrasted example ("Instead of going through dialog
boxes to change my font attributes, I can do it in my document in
real-time). Another example is when I show off Workspaces. By setting
one workspace in millions of colors and another in 256, I can show how
easy it is to preview a graphic in different color depths by dragging
it from one workspace to another.
</p></li><li><p>
Know the dark side of your software (and don't trespass).
</p><p>
For software to evolve, you have to try new things. Often this leads
to unstable, er, I mean, revolutionary features. If something doesn't
always work right, then stay away from it. Once you've got a demo put
together, run through it as many times as you can, assuring yourself
that everything works every time.
</p></li><li><p>
Do not hold a party when something goes wrong.
</p><p>
Yes, it'll happen someday and you should be prepared by not being
surprised. Okay, your software has crashed for one reason or another.
Do not call undue attention to the problem. You are not making the
first uncrashable application in the universe and nobody is expecting
this of you. Don't go into a long speech theorizing on possible
reasons for the crash. Hopefully, you can dismiss the crash dialog
box, restart your application, and continue from where you left off
with a simple, "Hmmm... let's try that again." At the end of the demo,
don't remind everyone by apologizing for the crash, just thank the
crowd for spending their time with you.
</p></li><li><p>
Demo in the visible portions of your screen.
</p><p>
Position your windows in the upper portion of your screen area so that
everyone can see. Moving windows around in the BeOS is snappy and
impressive, so although you were brought up not to fidget, fidgeting
with BeOS windows is a good thing. This also helps to call attention
to the window with which you are working.
</p></li><li><p>
Audio is king.
</p><p>
You might think that what you are showing on the screen is most
important, but actually audio rules a demo. If what you are showing
calls for audio, invest in a decent sound system. Robust sound lends
weight to a good demo.
</p></li><li><p>
Be humble.
</p><p>
Your application runs on an "alternative" operating system. You will
get the proud, the few, the ones that *need* you to know that they
can do everything you just did on their &lt;insert OS/ hardware combo
here&gt;. Be humble, nod your head, and say, "That's cool. Do you have
any questions I can answer?"
</p><p>
You're probably a small developer and your attitude should be, "I'm
just trying to produce powerful new software for you." Currently, Be
and its developers are the underdogs. Psychologically speaking,
there's something about rooting for an underdog, especially when
there's something about the underdog that's really good for which to
root. Who knows, someday our position in the world will change and
I'll write up a new set of demo guidelines.
</p></li><li><p>
Answer questions to the best of your ability.
</p><p>
When you're up in front of a crowd, your tendency is to want to
answer every single question fully. Sometimes that's just not
possible, so don't be afraid to invite someone to come up afterwards
to exchange business cards so you can do some homework and make sure
they get a correct answer. This also works for someone who is either
asking an impossible to answer question or who isn't asking a
question at all, but rather is using question time to make some kind
of statement (read the first part of #10 again).
</p></li><li><p>
Make a sacrifice to the demo gods.
</p><p>
I believe in gods, specifically, The Demo Gods. Before any demo I
give, I *always* make a sacrifice to them. This sacrifice is clean,
easy, and most importantly, blood free. Simply reboot the system.
</p><p>
Walking up to a computer that is in an unknown state is tempting The
Demo Gods to strike you down. It's also just common sense. Who knows,
perhaps someone was trying to test their software in low memory
environments and had run a utility that chewed up all but 6MB of RAM.
Giving a demo in this environment would be unnecessarily challenging.
</p></li><li><p>
Have fun.
</p><p>
Giving demos of powerful software is fun and gratifying. Don't forget
to enjoy yourself.
</p><p>
David Coursey also wrote an article awhile back on "How to give a
Great Demo." It's a little more general than my hints, but I found it
good reading. You can find it a copy on the web:

Ahhh... At last. It feels good to be using a nice new API long term. Do
you remember the time period that followed the release of DR8? A very
long period of uninterrupted development. Lots of apps created. Just take
a look at the old archives and you'll find a plethora of applications
that developers wrote in those glorious times. Thankfully, no one is
standing still, the same thing is starting to happen for the Preview
Release. We have a stable API, and the apps are just gushing forth. I
don't want to miss out on all the fun, so I thought I'd rev a couple of
my favorites of the past.

For those of you who have seen them before, just say ho hum and move on,
except you'll see some Preview specifics. For those of you who haven't
seen these before, they are:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="filename">imaging_PR.zip</code>—an example of how to do some direct <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>
manipulation. In this specific case the sample does some bilinear
scaling on a bitmap. It also shows it side by side with what you get by
default from the app_server. This clearly shows the tradeoffs between
speed and a different quality of scaling.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="filename">yags_PR.zip</code>—way back when, I had a dream that I would some day be
able to create a graphics system for my daughter. Yasmin Adams's
Graphics System is it. There are a whole bunch of 2D and a little bit
of 3D primitives in this library. The nifty thing about it is that it
will draw into anything that looks like a chunk of memory. There is
also a Game Kit specific version that will take advantage of hardware
acceleration if it can. This is a nice library to use if you are trying
to do some simple drawing into a chunk of memory like a <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>, the
screen, or just a icon buffer. And, you learn a little bit more about
using <code class="classname">BBitmap</code>s, <code class="classname">BScreen</code>,
and <code class="classname">BWindowScreen</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="filename">bebits_PR.zip</code>—How many times have you been sitting up late night
wishing you had a nice simple scheduler that would launch events on
time. Or allow you to write code like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<code class="function">snooze</code> (<code class="function">seconds</code>(3));
</pre><p>
Or create a simple queue or list, or do btree sorts, without having to
learn all of the STL library. Well, this is the place. A set of useful
C++ tools that take care of quite a few mundane tasks such as these.
bebits was originally called the esoteric library. Just a handful of
what I have found to be useful little tidbits of code that have been
tailored for use on the BeOS. You could probably spend a little bit of
time creating them yourself, and they probably don't do exactly what
you want, but they do save you time if they come close, and the source
is here, so you can tailor them to your liking.
</p></li></ul><p>
So what is it to be a developer support type person? Well, you support
developers any way you can. Providing code, advice, tutorials, marriage
counseling... The list can become fairly extensive. But first and
foremost, you have to love doing what you're doing. We try to spread our
infectious enthusiasm any way we can. These code samples are my humble
offerings.
</p><p>
As you'll see soon on our web site, we have been busy setting up a new
tutorials area. The idea is to make it easy for newcomers and oldtimers
alike to find that special little code sample that does just what they're
looking for. If you've ever wanted to know how to do off-screen drawing,
you should be able to find the answer fairly easily with our nice little
search engine-based tutorial pages.
</p><p>
What else can we possibly do? You developers have been giving us good
feedback, and we're acting on it. You keep generating those apps, and
we'll keep cheering and bringing in the water. Happy coding at the Front.

On the road again. Outside Heathrow we were asked what band we're in. Did
I miss something? The rock and roll world may have gone conservative
while I wasn't looking, but I would never have thought that Alex
Osadzinski, Wes Saia, Jean Calmon, Bill Bondie (our Parabooted ex-Navy
Seal investment banker), and yours truly could be mistaken for Mick,
Keith, and Bill. It must be the airline-proof anvil cases—the type
that roadies use to lug the band's gear. We carry around two of them, one
contains a dual-processor Umax and the other a generic Intel clone. These
cases have already raised a lot of money—for airlines—in excess
baggage charges.

Thankfully, not everyone is so confused. I landed in London early Monday
morning and, after suiting up in a double-breasted chameleon skin, I
climbed into one of the cherished English taxis. "King William Street,
please, I don't remember the number, but I'll find it." "Going to Mercury
Assets Management, guv?" The cabbie is a pin-stripe reader.

After the Boston Be Developer Conference and the Masters Awards, Alex has
updated the demo with new software. The Real-Time
<acronym class="acronym" title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG </acronym> examples and
the 3-D Kit kettle waltzing with the narcissistic cow help us illustrate
the kind of content creation and editing heretofore impossible at this
price level. Or, if you will, impossible with this very hardware running
older general -purpose operating systems. Our hosts ask hard questions:
How could Microsoft kill us? why focus exclusively on electronic
marketing and delivery of software? why do we think that the tractor apps
will come from new players?
</p><p>
Back at the hotel, the bell captain—or "porter" in the local dialect
—isn't confused either: He points at the Be logo on the cases and asks
Alex for his e-mail address. He wants to discuss Cyrix processors.

From London, we flew to Oslo, where I'm writing this. Two meetings with
high-tech investors and we'll be off to Paris and Geneva for more
presentations. Walking (a rare pleasure on this tour) from one meeting to
the next through the old town, we see students holding a textbook fair --
and cellular telephones. We're in the high-tech neighborhood of Europe,
the land of Linux, Ericsson and Nokia. We're here to raise "connected"
money, to attract investors who will link us to the wealth of local
software talent. In turn, the BeOS connects local developers to the world
market through its friction-free, Web-based distribution model.
</p><p>
All the while, we're also connected to the home base...

John Dvorak reports that Bill Campbell is Apple's next CEO. Bill's not
blond, Japanese or bisexual, features that a Silicon Valley wag claimed
were required to head Apple into the twenty-first century. But Bill's an
excellent leader, as he demonstrated at Intuit, plus he's a friend of
Steve, he's worked at Apple before (as VP of US Sales and Marketing), he
ran Claris, and, in ealier but not forgotten years, coached football at
Columbia. Overqualified and a great guy to boot. Let's hope.
</p><p>
John Swartz, from the SFO Chronicle, calls; he heard Apple wrote a letter
to Mac clone makers clarifying the company's position on CHRP. Allegedly,
Apple will not support CHRP, or will enforce restrictions amounting to
the same. There's much confusion surrounding the Mac cloning issue. For
Apple, cloning is a prisoner's dilemma: dead if you do, dead if you
don't. The debate is now 11 years old and still raging. It's the reason
why I wrote the "I love Apple so much I want two of them" column a few
weeks ago: I still believe that cleaving Apple's software from its
hardware is the best way to jump out of the nefarious dilemma. I
suggested that Guerrino De Luca, a Bill Campbell successor at Claris,
could run the software operation, while Steve Khang, the assertive head
of Power Computing, could do predictable wonders for the hardware
business. Taking the rumors at face value would mean that Apple wants to
return to its roots and stay in control of both hardware and software. As
indicated last week, I'll wait for these issues to settle a little bit
more before I attempt a fuller dissection.
