You may remember that BeOS Release 3 wasn't up to handling removable
media in a flexible way. The <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">IDE</acronym> drivers would fail to open if
there was no media in a drive. This caused applications like <span class="application">DriveSetup</span>
and <span class="application">Tracker</span> to open and close devices to check whether the media in the
drives had changed. There are several disadvantages to doing this:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The driver may be reloaded each time you check for media
</p></li><li><p>
You can't get information about drives with no media
</p></li><li><p>
You can't operate devices with no media
</p></li><li><p>
The driver decides if you should wait on a busy drive
</p></li></ul><p>
Let's look more closely at these problems. First, since BeOS unloads
drivers that are not in use, using open/close to detect media presence
often causes the driver to be reloaded. If the driver doesn't publish
other devices that are in use, keeping the driver loaded, the device can
never be opened when there is no media. The result is that every time you
check for media the driver has to be loaded and initialized, then open is
called, open fails, and the driver is unloaded. Since the <acronym class="acronym">IDE</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym>
drivers are built into the kernel, this is only a problem in Release 3 if
you use third party drivers.
</p><p>
The second problem is more serious. That is, you can't get any
information about a device. This means that an application like <span class="application">CDPlayer</span>
in Release 3 uses special devices that store information about all <acronym class="acronym">IDE</acronym>
and <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> devices. It then uses this information to tell which devices are
CD-ROM drives. So, for example, if you want to add a driver for a sound
card CD-ROM interface, <span class="application">CDPlayer</span> would not find your device. A less
serious problem is that you can't see the icon for a device unless there
is media in the drive.
</p><p>
Third, you can't operate devices with no media. This means that you can
only eject media, you can't open an empty tray or close the tray of a
CD-ROM drive.
</p><p>
Finally, the driver decides if you should wait on a busy drive. This
means that either the open fails or it blocks until the drive is ready.
The application may want to make that decision, so it can inform the user
that the drive is busy, instead of just blocking.
</p><p>
R4 solves these problems by adding an <code class="function">ioctl</code>,
<code class="constant">B_GET_MEDIA_STATUS</code>, to get
the media status. Open will succeed even if there is no media in the
drive, and the driver will accept commands that do not require the media
to be present. The following code shows how this ioctl can be used.
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">status_t</span> <code class="varname">media_status</code>;
if(<code class="function">ioctl</code>(<code class="varname">devfd</code>, <code class="constant">B_GET_MEDIA_STATUS</code>,
     &amp;<code class="varname">media_status</code>, <code class="function">sizeof</code>(<span class="type">status_t</span>)) &lt; 0)
{
  // old driver, abort
}

switch(<code class="varname">media_status</code>) {
  case <code class="constant">B_NO_ERROR</code>:
    <span class="comment">// drive ready with media</span>
    <span class="comment">// enable all controls</span>
    break;
  case <code class="constant">B_DEV_NO_MEDIA</code>:
    <span class="comment">// no media in drive</span>
    <span class="comment">// disable controls that need media</span>
    <span class="comment">// delete information about media</span>
    <span class="comment">// load eject still works</span>
    break;
  case <code class="constant">B_DEV_NOT_READY</code>:
    <span class="comment">// drive not ready.</span>
    <span class="comment">// disable controls, keep media information</span>
    break;
  case <code class="constant">B_DEV_MEDIA_CHANGED</code>:
    <span class="comment">// media in drive has changed</span>
    <span class="comment">// delete old and collect new information about media</span>
    break;
  case <code class="constant">B_DEV_MEDIA_CHANGE_REQUESTED</code>:
    <span class="comment">// user pressed eject button on drive</span>
    break;
#if R5
  case <code class="constant">B_DEV_DOOR_OPEN</code>;
    <span class="comment">// eject/load button loads</span>
    <span class="comment">// handle ad B_DEV_NO_MEDIA;</span>
    break;
#endif
  default:
    <span class="comment">// unknown state</span>
    break;
}
</pre><p>
R4 adds another <code class="function">ioctl</code>, <code class="constant">B_LOAD_MEDIA</code>,
that tries to load media into the
drive. Most CD-ROM drives use a tray to load CDs; for these drives
<code class="constant">B_LOAD_MEDIA</code> closes the tray if it is open. R4 does not define a separate
status for a drive with the door/tray open. If you want a combined
load/eject button, you need to know if the door is open or not. If you
need to do this, you can contact me about how to use the raw <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">ATAPI</acronym>
command interface, or you can wait for R5.
</p><p>
An important result of open succeeding with no media in the drive is that
you can now iterate through devices in
<code class="filename">/dev/disk</code> to find drives of a
specific type. This is very useful for <span class="application">CDPlayer</span>-type applications that
want to find all CD-ROM drives in the system. Note that CD-ROM changers
normally publish a separate device for each slot. In other words, make
sure you allow the user to easily switch between the devices you find.
</p><p>
The following code shows how to find CD-ROM devices:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">

}
</pre><p>
A final note if you are writing a disk driver that supports removable
media. To ensure that media changes aren't ignored, the change has to be
reported to all open file descriptors. When the driver detects that the
media has changed, it should set a flag for each file descriptor that the
media has changed. This flag should only be cleared by a
<code class="constant">B_GET_MEDIA_STATUS</code> <code class="function">ioctl</code>
on the corresponding file descriptor. This is
important, as it forces the caller to deal with the change. If the driver
doesn't behave this way it's possible for an application to read a buffer
from one disk, modify it, and write it back to another disk by accident.
</p><p>
For R4 only the <acronym class="acronym">IDE</acronym> drivers implement
<code class="constant">B_DEV_MEDIA_CHANGED</code>, so be careful
with other drives, just as you were in Release 3.

I've been preoccupied lately with the R4 Beta Test, so it came as a
surprise that I had two articles due this week, one for the Newsletter
and one for the Developer Letter. I tried to get one of my DTS minions to
pinch hit, but nothing doing. Being a manager is not all it's cracked up
to be.
</p><p>
So here's an article and sample code to introduce a couple of new
features of R4. The code runs only under R4, but you'll be getting that
soon enough.
</p><p>
The code can be found at:
</p><p>
ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/application_kit/Watcher.zip
</p><p>
Watcher is a very simple application. It keeps a current display of two
sets of items: the currently running applications (with the active
application in red), and a list of mounted and previously mounted
volumes, the latter in blue.
</p><p>
Both of these tasks could be performed in R3, but with difficulty. To
keep track of the apps, you had to poll the be_roster to get the list of
running applications, and then check to see which one was active. You had
to poll fairly constantly to keep the list up to date. On the volume
side, a simple call to <code class="classname">BVolumeRoster</code>::<code class="methodname">StartWatching()</code> would inform you
about mounting and unmounting volumes, but determining if a newly mounted
volume and a previously mounted volume with the same name were identical
was difficult at best.
</p><p>
New features in R4 make these trivial to implement, which is what I've
done in Watcher.
</p><p>
Watching applications is straightforward. The <code class="classname">BRoster</code> class now has
<code class="methodname">StartWatching()</code> and <code class="methodname">StopWatching()</code> functions, letting you specify a
<code class="classname">BMessenger</code> to receive notifications about launching, quitting, and
activating applications. The messages sent in response to these requests
contain the application signature, the <span class="type">team_id</span>, the main <span class="type">thread_id</span>, the
launch flags, and the <span class="type">entry_ref</span> for the application's binary. This
concise information allows Watcher to display the application names and
teams, and keep the list applications launched, quit, and newly activated
up to date.
</p><p>
Keeping track of unique volumes is also much easier in R4. A new
"be:volume_id" attribute is tagged onto the root folder of volumes. This
<span class="type">uint64</span> provides an identifier that persists between mountings of the
volume and boots of the BeOS. Now applications that need to uniquely
identify volumes (like back-up utilities or databases) have an easier
time. Watcher keeps track of all the persistent volumes mounted on the
machine, and displays the <span class="type">volume_id</span>, <span class="type">device id</span>, and name of each. When a
volume is unmounted, Watcher marks it in blue. When it is mounted again,
Watcher looks to see if it can find a match for the <span class="type">volume_id</span>, updating
the device number and name of each volume appropriately.
</p><p>
That's pretty much it for Watcher. If you want to take a bit more
advantage of its capabilities, you could expand it to watch
<acronym class="acronym" title="Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</acronym> type
information as well through the new <code class="classname">BMimeType</code>
<code class="methodname">StartWatching()</code> and
<code class="methodname">StopWatching()</code> functions. These inform a
<code class="classname">BMessenger</code> of changes made to
existing <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> types, but don't inform it when <acronym class="acronym">MIME</acronym> types are added or
deleted. Also, Watcher makes limited use of the new <code class="classname">BString</code> class for
(you guessed it) string manipulation.
</p><p>
Look for these and other interesting features when R4 is released.
</p><p>
And now back to beta testing...

This article is written for engineering-oriented software developers who
have a product to sell but have minimal marketing experience to guide
them in the business side of the venture. The article introduces the
concepts behind basic marketing research and offers practical examples of
methods for conducting and analyzing simple tests. References to some
more extensive web-based marketing research information are included at
the end.
</p><p>
Anyone with surplus "thrill genes" might want to avoid this article. I'm
going to spoil the fun and show you how to reduce the element of surprise
when making business decisions.
</p><p>
I know, I know—what fun is it without the risk? Do you really want to
give up the rush you get from making a big bet and waiting to discover
that a strategy works or doesn't? Do you need to experience the extreme
lows of utter failure to fuel your creative spurts?
</p><p>
I'm going to write about testing, measuring, and analyzing the collected
data (marketing research). In later articles I'll talk about
incorporating this data into the process of planning, projecting, and
budgeting. This will ultimately lead to talking about developing a
comprehensive business plan (groan). If you're not careful I might even
turn you into a dreaded bean counter.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id754362"></a>Statement</h3></div></div></div><p>
I'll start with a statement: You can test your marketing messages, ads,
prices, offers, and other marketing efforts. You can measure the results
of these tests, compare them with the results of other marketing efforts,
and use the collected data to make decisions, forecasts, and predictions.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id754378"></a>Testing and Measurement</h3></div></div></div><p>
The best way to get into this is to use a simple, practical example.
Suppose you're wondering about the best way to make an effective demo
version of your product. Do you want to have a limited-time,
full-featured version that does everything but expires after a certain
number of days, or do you want a version that limits what the user can do
with your product? There are arguments for and against both approaches.
For example, if you provide a full-featured version, are you unknowingly
telling your users that your product can be used for free, even though
the demo version has an expiration date? If you provide a limited
version, will potential customers get a poor idea of the program's
capabilities?
</p><p>
To decide what to do CONDUCT A TEST AND ANALYZE THE RESULTS! (I want to
encourage you to answer EVERY question by saying, "Test it.")
</p><p>
Here's an example of a hypothetical test. Create both versions of the
product and make them available to potential customers in a controlled
manner, then track the results of the test. Perhaps you could make your
demos available from web sites that will attract similar demographics. Or
perhaps you could place a web ad that directs people to a special web
page you've set up where you can switch the offering on every hour or day
or so. These are examples of methods of collecting data about the
behavior of potential customers in response to your offering.
</p><p>
It's important to keep track of all the data that comes from your test.
Track how many people visit the web page. If you are using this method to
track responses remember not to use the "hit count" because that reflects
each file downloaded, including graphics, which can greatly inflate the
count. Instead, track the separate IP addresses of your visitors. If
you're using an ISP for you web page, many ISPs provide this information.
Or you can use a counter that displays the number of visitors. Along with
the number of visitors, be sure to track how many people download the
different versions of the demo.
</p><p>
There are a lot of things you can also track that might not seem obvious
but can yield useful information. Perhaps you can track what time of day
people visit your web page. Perhaps from this you can surmise whether
you're getting a lot of visitors from Europe or Germany based on the time
of the hits. A more advanced web host (like Webcom) can even track where
on the web people came from to get to your page. (It is said among direct
marketing types that those direct mail record and CD clubs even test the
different response forms with different colors of paper, and whether an
initial offer of 4 records for a penny brings in a higher response than
charging a dime—as well as whether these different factors influence
how many initial members later default on their memberships!)
</p><p>
In addition to tracking this data you should set up a form and take the
name and e-mail of everyone who downloads any version of the demo. This
will help keep track of what these individuals do later.
</p><p>
Control of the test is very important. You need to be sure of what you're
measuring. If data is sneaking in or out the back door you could wind up
with inaccurate information. You aren't sure that you're getting accurate
data if you don't have a way to be sure that what you believe to be the
sample size is accurate. You also need to anticipate other factors that
might affect your measurement of response.
</p><p>
Having purchased Gobe Productive for this purpose, you should set up a
spreadsheet to track and compare the information you're collecting. If
you analyze the data collected from this part of this imaginary test
you'll learn:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
How many people download the product demo after viewing the web
page. (You can try different approaches and see how many more people
become interested enough to download. This will also help you craft
your overall marketing message.)
</p></li><li><p>
If you placed an ad you've learned how many people visit the web
page after seeing it. (You can try different ads or different offers
and MEASURE the difference they make.)
</p></li><li><p>
If you specify that the demo version is "function-limited" or
"time-limited" you'll learn whether more people prefer to download one
over the other.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Let's continue this hypothetical test and find out whether and how the
different demos affect purchases. To do this, you need to track how many
of the people who downloaded the demo later purchase your product. I can
think of a number of ways to accomplish this. One is to match the name of
the person with a later BeDepot sales report or other sale of the
product. Another might be to give them a discount in a way that you can
track whether they use the discount. Maybe you could offer this in a
ReadMe that comes with the demo with a "tracking number" or something
that lets you know it came from the demo. If you have more sophisticated
capabilities from your web provider and some resources to set this up you
can automate this kind of tracking and matching the user up to a later
purchase.
</p><p>
After you match those who have downloaded the demo with those who later
purchase the product you have some more valuable data:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>
The percentage of people who download the full time-limited version
and later purchase the product.
</p></li><li><p>
The percentage of people who download the feature-limited version
and later purchase the product.
</p></li><li><p>
If you tracked earlier data well or expanded your test you also
learn how different ads, marketing messages, etc., later increase
purchases.
</p></li><li><p>
With more sophisticated tracking over a longer time you can even
learn the long-term purchasing behavior of these customers. For
example, do people who start with a full-featured demo later purchase
more upgrades?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Is there an increase in purchases by people for whom you can't account?
In other words, did making the demo available increase sales among people
other than those you could track—friends sending the demo around,
people who saw the web page and didn't download the demo but still
purchased it, or just a general effect from the exposure? If you find
this happens consistently you can include it as a factor in determining
revenue projections and planning.
</p><p>
Think about the implications of this simple test. You KNOW how many
people who get your demo later purchase your product. I don't have to
tell you the value of this kind of information. You can calculate the
cost and return of distributing demos. In a later article I'll go into
detail on this subject. It's relatively easy to learn this kind of
valuable information, and since you CAN test these things it follows that
you SHOULD.
</p><p>
Knowing the value of this information, let's put it to some practical
use. Let's say you have to decide whether to press a CD with your demo
version and decide how to distribute it. You have some information now
that will help make this decision. You've probably decided which is the
better demo—full-featured and time-limited or feature-limited. You've
collected and analyzed some data about the effectiveness of your
marketing message. You have some info about response to web ads. You also
know the percentage of people who purchase your product after trying your
demo.
</p><p>
Let's make another decision based on this information. Should you spend a
ton of money to put an ad on Yahoo! to promote your product and
distribute demos? Assuming that the demographic you'll reach with this ad
is similar to the one you reached with the earlier ad you can estimate
the results—within limits (see below).
</p><p>
To extend these basics a little further, should you try mailing the demo
CD directly to people? You can use the data you've collected, as long as
you recognize that there's a difference between responding to a web ad
and receiving an unsolicited demo CD. (Later, of course, we'll TEST it.)
Let's say it costs you a dollar to make a CD and a dollar to mail it. So
your hypothetical distribution cost is $2/CD. Now let's pretend that from
earlier tests you've learned that 3% of the people who get the demo later
purchase the product. That means that you'll get 3 sales for every $200
that you spend on these CDs with this distribution method. All of this
looks like a perfect reason to purchase a spreadsheet program like
BeatWare's Sum-It.

After cranking all of this hypothetical data through your spreadsheet
you'll find that if you get more than $66 of revenue from each unit you
sell, this method is worth looking into. Actually sending bulk mail costs
considerably less than a dollar and pressing CDs in quantity costs less,
too. Remember to account for this in your spreadsheets. Additionally,
increasing exposure will bring additional sales. So from this use of the
data collected in our tests above you now know that it is worthwhile to
design a test of direct mail.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id754547"></a>Limits</h3></div></div></div><p>
Keep in mind that you should always be testing and analyzing all the data
you receive. Every ad should be considered as a test, even if it was
placed as a the result of a previous test. Always test small and then
increase the scope of the test based on the results of earlier tests. In
direct mail a general rule of thumb is to never mail to more than 10
times your test. So if you test by mailing to 1,000 people, don't mail to
more than 10,000 people based on the results of that test. And then the
10,000 mailing becomes a test from which you decide whether to mail to
100,000, and so on.

These are scientific methods, and as I said at the beginning, this
article is written for engineers who find themselves in business. After
you're familiar with using scientific methods to get answers to business
problems you'll develop an almost software-debugging-like approach.
Testing, tracking, and developing spreadsheets to address business
problems can be approached in a manner similar to developing software
solutions to engineering problems.

This has been a simple introduction to the basics of marketing research.
Now that you've gotten a taste of it, perhaps you'll want to learn more.
Below is some web-based info I've discovered in the last few days from
surfing around on the subject of "marketing research."

As one Apple wag used to say, the good thing about standards is that
there are so many to choose from. That was said about ten years ago by
Larry Tesler, known for his dry wit and his early work on the Lisa. Ten
years later, we have even more standards, more confusion and, as a
result, more difficulty establishing new standards.
</p><p>
Take <acronym class="acronym" title="High Definition TeleVision">HDTV</acronym> and Digital TV,
for instance. Last weekend, the local and
national press, namely The New York Times, The San Francisco Chronicle,
and The San Jose Mercury News
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/10/biztech/articles/26hdtv.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/10/biztech/articles/26hdtv.html</a>,
<a class="ulink" href="http://eXaminer.com/981101/1101goodman.shtml">http://eXaminer.com/981101/1101goodman.shtml</a>, and
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/unmarked/wire/89273l.htm">http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/unmarked/wire/89273l.htm</a>) all
wrote skeptical articles about the beginning of <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym> broadcasting. The
skepticism is largely warranted by a long list of obstacles that <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym>
must overcome before it becomes a reality. The sets are too expensive,
the broadcasts are too few, the new equipment to produce <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym> content is
more expensive, and, in any event, consumers don't care and wouldn't know
the difference.
</p><p>
In many respects, it's chicken and egg situation, a vicious circle: no
viewers, no broadcasts. The situation is made worse by the carriers,
cable and satellite systems. The federal government has some power to
dictate the use of the ordinary broadcast spectrum—hence the few hours
of <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym> broadcast in the major markets (see the map in the <acronym class="acronym">NYT</acronym> story) --
but the cable industry feels no real pressure to make costly updates to
infrastructure and cancel a few home shopping channels in order to free
bandwidth for <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym>.
</p><p>
Furthermore, consumers don't know what <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym> is. They don't know the
difference between <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">DTV</acronym> and Digital Television. They don't
realize that broadcasters and cable operators would rather have several
digital channels than one <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym> program. And, speaking of digital
channels, because of cable and satellite systems, more and more TV today
is "digital," even if the viewer doesn't realize it. Yet this isn't what
the industry means by digital <acronym class="acronym">TV</acronym>, which, in turn is different from <acronym class="acronym">HDTV</acronym>.
This confusion does not make the consumer feel smarter and safer, the
necessary preconditions to separating him or her from a sizeable sum of
money.
</p><p>
In general at Be, we love to see a little transition confusion in the
marketplace; it creates an easier situation for us to carve new terrain,
if we move fast enough and place the right bets. On the other hand,
confusion paralysis doesn't help us. A reasonably clear DTV/HDTV picture,
if you pardon the expression, would help the industry invest in content
creation tools, and we would love to be of service in this domain.
</p><p>
Closer to us, there is a more modest standard called FireWire, IEEE-1394,
or <acronym class="acronym">i.LINK</acronym>, as Sony calls it for their <acronym class="acronym">DV</acronym> cameras. This one, after about
ten years in development, now seems ready to take off. Compaq offers it
on selected Presario models and Sony on the GX version of their sexy new
505 laptop. This is promising, and, as soon as <acronym class="acronym">DV</acronym> cameras cost less than
the PC in charge of editing the DV tapes, we'll finally reach desktop
video heaven—a nice opportunity for us to please a large number of
users.
</p><p>
DV cameras really create a new standard of quality and usability well
within the financial reach of the consumer. Better pictures, smaller
cameras, easier connection to a computer. That shouldn't confuse
consumers too much and my friends the marketing haruspices assure me 1999
will be the year of <acronym class="acronym">DV</acronym> and, as a result, the year of FireWire.
</p><p>
The Presario model I saw at Costco the other day bore witness to the
advent of another nice standard:
<acronym class="acronym" title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</acronym>. This computer offers three
connectors up front (NOT in the back), <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym>, FireWire—or digital
photo camera, scanner and <acronym class="acronym">DV</acronym> camera—the perfect system for our
customer and our product.
</p><p>
<acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> also took a long time to happen (though only half as long as
FireWire) and finally delivers much nicer low- to medium-speed peripheral
connectivity. No more fighting for serial ports or risking sanity by
adding ports to your PC. To borrow language from corporate America,
FireWire and <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> lower the cost of owning a media manipulation system.
</p><p>
The only piece of bad news—temporary we hope—is the accumulation of
all these standards in a PC. Serial and parallel connectors, as well as
<acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> and FireWire, <acronym class="acronym">IDE</acronym> and
<acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym>, must coexist on some motherboards, just
as <acronym class="acronym">PCI</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">ISA</acronym> do. This standard medley adds cost and complexity to
today's PCs, but that's an infinitely better situation than the vicious
circle that's likely to paralyze the progress of a new TV standard, a
problem sadly without apparent solution.
