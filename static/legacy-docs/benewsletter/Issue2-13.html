You're in your back yard with a basket of ducks and an ax. You grab a
duck out of the basket, chop off its head, and then put the body back in
the basket. You repeat the process until a neighbor stops by and idly
reaches in and grabs a duck—the same duck that you're reaching for.
But you don't notice that your neighbor has your duck, so instead of
chopping off a duck's head, you chop off your own hand. What you've got
is a synchronization problem.
</p><p>
Operating systems can have synchronization problems, too. One problem
that was recently brought to our attention was this: How do you protect a
large array of data (a basket of ducks) so multiple threads (neighbors)
can uniquely access different elements without locking up the entire
array?
</p><p>
An obvious way to enforce this sort of protection is to create an array
of semaphores that matches the size of the data array. Each semaphore
would control access to a specific element in the data array.
Unfortunately, this is a general solution only if the semaphore pool is
infinite. But it's not, so it isn't.
</p><p>
The solution we came up with is to use an array of semaphores of a much
smaller size than the size of the array; each semaphore is responsible
for the protection of N elements. The way you map semaphores to data
depends on the way the array is usually accessed. If the access is
typically sequential, you could use a simple modulo function:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
&lt;type&gt; <code class="varname">data_array</code>[<code class="constant">SIZE_ARRAY</code>];
<span class="type">sem_id</span> <code class="varname">semaphores</code>[<code class="constant">SIZE_SEM</code>];

Voila—very simple to use and gives you most of the concurrency that a
full semaphore array would give you! You could, of course, use benaphores
instead of semaphores to boost the performance.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id555002"></a>Another Problem</h3></div></div></div><p>
Another problem you might find is the need for a thread to be able to
make nested acquire and release calls on the same semaphore. For example,
let's say you've written a recursive function that has the recursion
point in the middle of a protected section:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">tailspin</code>()
{
  ...
  <code class="function">acquire_sem</code>(<code class="varname">a</code>);
  if (...)
    <code class="function">tailspin</code>();
  <code class="function">release_sem</code>(<code class="varname">a</code>);
  ...
}
</pre><p>
A simple semaphore won't work: The second time you try to acquire the
semaphore, you'll block, since the semaphore doesn't know that you are
the thread that already holds the lock!
</p><p>
Here's a simple way to do it:
</p><pre class="programlisting c">

Now you can write your function as...
</p><pre class="programlisting c">
<span class="type">void</span> <code class="function">tailspin</code>()
{
  ...
  <code class="function">do_lock_multi</code>();
  if (...)
    <code class="function">tailspin</code>();
  <code class="function">do_unlock_multi</code>();

Once again, you could replace the semaphore by a benaphore.

While looking at Application Server performance, I noticed that some
applications are using the <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code> mode to draw bitmaps that don't

Tens of thousands of people visit the Be Web site every week in a quest
for information. Some of these people know exactly what they want --
they've seen the Be Web site dozens of times and are interested primarily
in a few key items. Others are new to Be and the BeOS and want basic
information. It's inevitable that some of these people will click on one
of those little "mailto:webmaster@be.com" links at the bottom of every
Web page and submit e-mail. Some people will search the Web site long and
hard and will think carefully before sending their e-mail (that's good),
while others will click the "mailto" link as soon as possible and ignore
the information on the Web site in order to have their hand held.
</p><p>
Some of the more common e-mails are presented below, for your perusal.
</p><p>
"The following link is broken."<br />
"There's a misspelling on this page."
</p><p>
We love broken link reports! Spelling error reports too! If it's broken
or misspelled on the Be Web site, then we aren't aware of it yet. Broken
links and spelling errors are typically fixed within minutes of us
reading the report. Just send along the URL of the erroneous document
with the error and we'll fix it.
</p><p>
"More your development is prayed".<br />
"I have received disturbed version of BeOS."<br />
"Why does motherboard smoke?"
</p><p>
Some of our users do not speak English as their native language, and
interpreting some of their e-mail can be tricky. Phrases like "More your
development is prayed" (Amen!) pop up from time to time, as do paragraphs
whose sentence structure resembles haiku ("Be is wonderful. More OS do
you provide. Soon will I buy it.") Unfortunately, these brave souls are
trying to translate their language straight into English, and it doesn't
always come out right. We try to match up the writer with someone at Be
who might have a better chance of speaking their native language, but
that's not always possible, and we're forced to guess what the e-mail
means. Sometimes "Why does motherboard smoke" actually means "I
unsoldered some diodes on the motherboard and it started smoking."
</p><p>
"Could I please please please please please get a beta of the BeOS? I've
tested lots of other kewl stuff and I need the BeOS now! I need the BeOS!
I need the BeOS! I need the BeOS! Now! Now! Now!"
"I will give you my left arm for a beta version of the BeOS."
</p><p>
Boy, we received tons of e-mail like this from the 1996 August Macworld
through our MacTech CD release. Since we don't have the beta program
these people imagine, we couldn't send them anything. If we ever start a
beta program where we distribute beta copies of the BeOS to the general
public (don't hold your breath), sign-up instructions will be plainly
posted on the Be Web site, believe me. In the meantime, users can sign up
on the Web site for Preview Release notification at
&lt;http://www.be.com/products/beos_preview/index.html&gt;.
</p><p>
(The actual e-mails used more exclamation points, too.)
</p><p>
"Why don't you have any animated GIFs on your site?"
</p><p>
Animated GIFs are a "third-party opportunity." In fact, Macworld's
on-line presence usually has some interesting ones involving the Be logo.
Frames, Java, and JavaScript are also left for others to implement on
their own sites. There are too many improvements we can make to the site
that don't require delving into those technologies.
</p><p>
"I read something about you guys somewhere—tell me all about your
company and products"
</p><p>
Sorry, we don't like to give out information like that.
</p><p>
"Will the BeOS work on my Power Mac? I've checked the Web site, but I'm
certain you're withholding information and actually know more than you're
telling."
</p><p>
This isn't the X-Files, so no, our BeOS Compatibility Chart shares most
current information we have. No conspiracies here, Mulder.
</p><p>
"You guys suck!"
</p><p>
Detailed descriptions of why we suck are much more useful.
</p><p>
"You guys rule!"
</p><p>
Well, detailed descriptions of why we rule are also useful. It always
helps to know why we're good or bad in a customer's eyes.
</p><p>
"Your Web site is the greatest! You're the greatest Webmaster ever!"
</p><p>
Uh, Mom, quit writing to me at work.
</p><p>
"This Web site feature is really nice, but I wish it did x, y, or z, too."
</p><p>
Running a Web site like Be's is a lot like fighting the hydra (see
Theseus v. Hydra, 4000 B.C.). Every time we add a new feature, visitors
request two more features that could extend the site's functionality even
further. This happens with just about everything: A day after the bug
reports were placed on-line, we received requests for bug searches by
developer ID. Suggestions are excellent and we definitely evaluate every
one, but sometimes receiving feature requests can be frustrating, since
it's often tougher to implement features than the user realizes (in this
case, though, bug searching by developer ID will be implemented). That
said, feature requests are always encouraged.
</p><p>
Speaking of the on-line bug reports, we've observed some interesting side
effects of placing them on the Web that we really didn't anticipate. Some
people are going back through their bugs from last year and writing to
say, "Actually it isn't a bug, I figured out what I was doing wrong."
Others are sifting through the "unreproducible" bugs and trying to
reproduce them. Once they manage to reproduce them in a reliable manner,
they write to tell us how. These are great time-savers for us and a
totally unexpected artifact of placing the bugs on-line.
</p><p>
Another interesting side effect is an increased rate of bug reporting. We
were receiving a bug every few days before posting them on the Web site;
now we're receiving four or five every day. Either by raising the
awareness of the fact that we accept bug reports on-line, or by showing
that maybe we haven't heard about every bug people have found, we're
getting more reports. Solid, reproducible bugs only help to improve the
next release of the BeOS....
</p><p>
The Web site has other improvements on the way, including:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A more condensed BeWare format in addition to the current one. With
well over 300 registered applications, things have been getting crowded
in BeWare.
</p></li><li><p>
More programming tutorials. The reaction to the "Approaching Be"
tutorial has been outstanding, and more tutorials are in the works --
especially as the Preview Release draws near.
</p></li><li><p>
Better integration of the Web site and list server.
</p></li><li><p>
An even beefier Support area, integrated with our other support
methods.
</p></li></ul><p>
Recently, Michael Alderete has come on board at Be to provide Web-based
support information. He monitors the various channels through which we
receive trouble notifications and posts the answers in the Support area
of the Web site (&lt;http://www.be.com/support/index.html&gt;). One of our
goals is to have people check the Web site first whenever they have a
problem—the vast majority of the questions people ask are already
answered there. While people are welcome to write to CustSupport@be.com,
and Webmaster@be.com for customer support, and Web site issues, it's
often quicker and easier to check the Support area of the Web site for
answers first!

HDTV, Convergence, DVD, CD-ROM, I'm so confused! Here we are approaching
the dawn of a new millennium, and I don't even own a home stereo system!
My TV consists of the monitor from my Commodore 64 hooked up to a 12 year
old VCR. Am I ready for the digital age?
</p><p>
Luckily, my computer systems are much better equipped. My <span class="trademark">BeBox</span>™ has a
Hauppauge digitizer tuner, which is just as good as having a TV on my
desktop while I work. Nothing like I Love Lucy reruns to keep you
productive. The first taste of video I had on the BeBox was a QuickCam
driver. And then the Hauppauge board hooked me up to a VCR or camera, and
now, the driver supports the TV/cable tuner. I'm a pig in slop I tell you.
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/Samples/tvtune.tgz&gt;
</p><p>
I just makes me laugh. A couple of years ago, a video digitizer cost so
much, and now I have a complete digitally tunable TV on a card. Who needs
a V-chip, how about an application that senses the commercials and blanks
them out. I expect someone to create a VCR. Just like in Windows you have
those "rack" applications that show a nice stereo console for CD, MIDI,
.WAV, and all that. How about a TV, VCR, camcorder, "rack." I'm waiting...
</p><p>
April Fools! I always hate this because I'm a bit gullible and can never
quite tell when I'm being taken. I recently read an article that talked
about a computer based on tubes from Russia. I should have known. It's
simply too outrageous to think that there could be a computer that you
could make run faster or slower by turning a knob, but I was falling for
it, then I checked the date on the magazine and slapped my forehead.
</p><p>
Well, wouldn't it be great if there were an April fool's issue of
something that made a bunch of outlandish claims that all turned out to
be true.
</p><p>
April 1, 1997<br />
MENLO PARK
</p><p>
Today, in an announcement that shocked and elated an industry, small
upstart Be, Inc. has become the de facto standard operating system.
Several industry insiders were contacted to get their reactions to the
stunning news.
</p><p>
Larry Ellison of prophetic orb fame had this to say, "I was going to buy
Apple, but once I consulted with my guru, I found out that the OS was the
most important component of a system, and I gave up on Apple and invested
in Be."
</p><p>
Bill Gates, famed ski bunny and island hopper stated, "When you have as
much money as I do, you don't get bothered with the details. DOS and
Windows have been good to me. I had given up on the OS game and started
concentrating on my house. When I found that all the components in my
house ran the BeOS, I decided to invest big time, except, they won't
return my calls.
</p><p>
Jon Warnock, Gil Amelio, and Steve Jobs could not be reached for comment.
</p><p>
In other news, to further enhance their capabilities as a digital content
creation platform, Be's famed developer support organization released yet
another of their fine sample applications, proving once again that being
good doesn't have to come hard.
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/gfx/lib/imaging.tgz&gt;
</p><p>
The sample is said to hold the secrets to high-speed bitmap manipulation
using the BeOS. William Adams, the creator of the library simply said,
"Hey, why the heck not."

Writing a column on April Fool's Day brings many tempting topics to mind.
But a fake press release, with a carefully selected choice of buzzwords
and content-free sentences trumpeting Be's licensing of OpenDoc, would be
poor timing after all. It's one thing to have fun at the expense of the
powerful, it's another to satirize people when they're in trouble. And we
find several recent decisions at Apple, such as dropping OpenDoc, rather
encouraging. OpenDoc had ambitious goals, but the size of the
implementation, its timing, and the arrival of Java made it a problematic
proposition even before the purchase of NeXT.
</p><p>
Still on the April Fool's topic, Gateway 2000 just announced their
acquisition of the assets of Amiga Technologies, the German company that
had acquired rights to the Amiga from Commodore after the company went
under. I learned this from one of our engineers, an early Amiga fan, who
e-mailed me a copy of a Reuters dispatch. Seeing the date, knowing he's
prone to pranks, remembering his association with the Amiga, I thought he
had crafted the whole story and proceeded to congratulate him on yet
another bit of creative writing. At first, I didn't believe his protests,
he was laughing too hard while explaining he was too busy working on DR9.
He pointed me to Gateway's Web site, and I stopped suspecting a prank
when I saw the March 27 date on the Gateway announcement. My guess is
that Gateway is looking for multimedia expansions to their product line.
They've been shipping the large-screen PC TV for a while, and Amiga used
to be the multimedia innovator in the PC business before Commodore and
Escom (the German company that owned Amiga Technologies) got in trouble,
taking the Amiga with them. Amiga technologies might have had some
exciting technology under development. We'll see. It's good to know a
company such as Gateway is interested in the Amiga world.

Last week I received more e-mail than usual following my column on
developments in the ISP business. I expressed hope that the ISP business
would move away from the all-you-can- eat fixed-pricing model. Readers
appeared mostly supportive of that position. Some pointed out they had
been doing it for some time, others hoped that very inexpensive basic
access would be maintained while more expensive tiers are developed,
offering better speed, better access guarantees, or a broader range of
personal Web hosting services, for instance. What was even more pleasant
was that some of the e-mail came from outside the US. The Internet hasn't
always developed overseas as fast as in the US, but the interest isn't
weaker, it's mostly a problem of government-owned telcos often not being
very competitive. This isn't the case everywhere. Scandinavian countries,
for instance, are both very wired and very wireless (for example,
Ericsson and Nokia) and have a high rate of net use. And Finland begot
Linux.
</p><p>
One reader questioned my choice of topic. What does the ISP business have
to do with the BeOS business? As one investor put it, Be was born on the
Web. Without the Web, I doubt we'd still exist. I doubt we could
evangelize, agitprop, support, and distribute without the Web. Netscape,
Sun, and others have shown that the Web has opened up new opportunities,
new avenues for new platforms. They make the case there are alternatives
to the "one OS" view of the world. They make the case so well the giant
finally woke up. Without a healthy ISP industry, the net gets a lot less
interesting, less investment, less competition, less progress, less silly
experimenting, less serendipity. All this matters a great deal to our
developers and to ourselves.

BeDevTalk is an unmonitored discussion group in which technical
information is shared by Be developers and interested parties. In this
column, we summarize some of the active threads, listed by their subject
lines as they appear, verbatim, in the mail.

More UI and functionality suggestions for the Open/Save Panel:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Let the user type a pathname.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide a "file dependency" check; if the user deletes a file
upon which other files depend, an alert (or whatever) should open.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide a means for sizing the panel as a percentage of the
monitor size.
</p></li></ul><p>
This last suggestion (the panel should be proportioned to the monitor)
was met with disagreement: The panel should simply remember the size
that the user last set it to. But what happens when you switch between
workspaces that are running at different screen size resolutions?

File system questions and answers:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Does the journaller journal data? No, just the file system
structure.
</p></li><li><p>
Should the journaller log data changes? Mixed reaction, here.
Some folks think it would be a good idea, others think that if you
want to protect the integrity of your data, you should simply
practice safe saving in your app.
</p></li><li><p>
Can the journal for disk A be written to disk B? Not in DR9.
</p></li><li><p>
Will third parties be able to write a file system handler? Yes,
but not yet... the file system handler interface won't be published
in DR9.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id555815"></a>NEW</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id555821"></a>Subject: Be debugger</h4></div></div></div><p>
Debugger requests:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Allow the debugger to be preloaded so it will respond faster to a
crash.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide a no-update debugger mode. It's difficult to debug a
full-screen game (for example) when the debugger adds uncertainty.
</p></li><li><p>
It would really be nice if the debugger could pop through the
stack frames.
</p></li><li><p>
The debugger should support copy and paste.

Subject: Solution to the key/button problem<br />
Subject: To BeBoxes have an option key?<br />
Subject: Interface Experts
</h5></div></div></div><p>
Cursor keys: Should they display a default behavior? Will this be
described in the UI Guidelines? Peter Urbanec provided a detailed list
of suggested behaviors.
</p><p>
There was also multiple mouse click and modified mouse click talk: What
message(s) should an app receive when the user clicks the mouse? Should
the user be able to remap these messages?
</p><p>
Finally: Are "Human Interface" experts worthwhile?
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id555896"></a>Subject: File Servers/Attributes</h4></div></div></div><p>
An initial query—what happens to a file's attributes when it's
copied to a non-BeFS machine?—led to a comparison with other file
systems. This led to a discussion of NFS; specifically, is TCP or UDP
better suited for network file transfer? Some folks think the TCP
overhead isn't worth the heightened reliability, particularly since
file transfer is "error prone" anyway. Well, then, what about T/TCP?

Building a better mousetrap. A suggestion for an improved benaphore was
posted. Listeners wrote in with comments.
