In the upcoming release of the <span class="trademark">BeOS</span>™, Developer Release 8 (DR8), we
introduce two new kits and assorted new and improved API to help satisfy
the needs of developers who work and play in the graphics world. The new
kits are:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The Game Kit, our first pass at delivering specialized API that fits
the needs of digital game designers
</p></li><li><p>
The 3D Kit, an "in-box" solution for designing, rendering, and
interacting with three-dimensional figures and settings
</p></li></ul><p>
This article gives an overview of the design philosophies and features of
these two kits and also looks, briefly, at the state of the graphics card
API. If you want to read more (much more) about the 3D Kit, visit the Be
world-wide web site, where you'll find a new 3D Kit white paper
(http://www.be.com/developers/3DWhitePaper.html).
</p><p>
But first, you may have read that Be has recently licensed OpenGL®, the
popular 3D programming interface. The implementation of OpenGL® that
we'll initially support is based on the latest library and toolkit from
Silicon Graphics. Unfortunately, the implementation won't be ready until
after DR8. In the future, we'll optimize our OpenGL® implementation for
the BeBox: We'll drop into assembly language for critical sections,
support accelerated 3D graphic cards, and provide parallel 3D processing.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492686"></a>The Game Kit</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Game Kit is new in DR8. Its main feature—currently, its only
feature—is the BWindowScreen class. Through the use of a BWindowScreen
object, your application can take over the entire screen; no dock, no
Browser windows, just the images that you want to display spread across
the entire canvas. In addition, BWindowScreen knows about multiple
workspaces, so you can set up a different BWindowScreen object in each
workspace.
</p><p>
Other features of the BWindowScreen class include:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
More and faster control of the graphics card
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to set different (possibly nonstandard) resolutions
(sorry, no VGA yet)
</p></li><li><p>
The use of multiple buffers or hardware scrolling
</p></li><li><p>
Fast, asynchronous access to the color map
</p></li><li><p>
Fast access to the graphics card's accelerated functions (they're
copied into your application's memory space)
</p></li></ul><p>
Best of all, everything is completely transparent to the BeOS, so the
machine is still completely alive (unlike the deadly lock_screen()
function that BWindowScreen replaces).
</p><p>
Note that most of the Game Kit's advanced features use the new API for
graphic add-ons (described below). Not all of these features will be
available for every card; a list of cards that work with the Game Kit
will be published with DR8.
</p><p>
In a future release (we'll try for DR9), BWindowScreen will be extended
to support standard VGA mode (the application will be responsible for
setting specific modes using the standard VGA registers). The class will
then be useful for much more than just displaying game animation. Other
future release features include:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Incorporation of the joystick into the Game Kit (note that you can
find a new BJoyStick class in the DR8 Device Kit)
</p></li><li><p>
Direct communication between BWindowScreen objects and the 3D Kit or
OpenGL®
</p></li><li><p>
Advanced feature support for a wider range of graphics cards
</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492787"></a>Graphics Driver API</h3></div></div></div><p>
In DR7, we introduced a very simple and limited API for graphics drivers,
in which drivers are loaded as add-ons. For DR8 we've slightly extended
the graphics driver API, mostly to provide support for the Game Kit.
Drivers that are using the DR7 version of the add-on API are still
supported in DR8.
</p><p>
The graphics card add-on scheme isn't perfect yet. There are still a
couple of important features missing:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A minimal, specific set of accelerated 3D calls
</p></li><li><p>
A general API for accessing a card's extended features
</p></li><li><p>
The resolution/depth/refresh-rate settings need to be cleaned up
</p></li></ul><p>
The changes that we've planned for DR9 are much more significant than
those presented in DR8. For example, we'll probably rework the API for
clarity and stability; because of this, existing graphics add-ons won't
be compatible in DR9. We will, of course, provide new drivers for all the
graphics cards that are on the official support list, so the
incompatibility shouldn't be too painful for most developers. If you're
developing a graphics driver and are worried about these change, please
get in touch with us by e-mail, at graphics-card@be.com.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492833"></a>The 3D Problem</h3></div></div></div><p>
3D is an amazingly hard problem. We can easily identify the reasons:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Three-dimensional descriptions are much more complex than
descriptions in two dimensions
</p></li><li><p>
Many programmers aren't at all comfortable with the mathematical
tools that are used to handle 3D geometry
</p></li><li><p>
Thinking in 3D isn't easy. The mapping of a three- dimensional object
to a two-dimensional screen isn't always intuitive
</p></li></ul><p>
For these reasons, 3D is mostly used for creating games, synthesizing
pictures or frames of animation, and in expensive CAD programs. The needs
of each of these three application domains is significantly different:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Games don't need a general solution—their problems are very
specific and controlled, but they have to be cheap, fast, and fun.
</p></li><li><p>
Picture synthesis needs to be arbitrarily complex, which means the
tools are complicated and numerous. Because of the complexity of the
tools, picture synthesis is slow and can't be done in real time.
</p></li><li><p>
CAD programs are, in a way, the worst of both worlds. Like picture
synthesis, they have to allow descriptions of complex objects (and
relationships between objects). But a CAD program must also provide a
reasonable level of (near) real-time interaction.
</p></li></ul><p>
To provide a solution to the problem, most of the available 3D libraries
(including OpenGL®, Renderman, and QuickDraw 3D) are huge and complex.
Consequently, the users of these products need to have a nontrivial level
of 3D knowledge.
</p><p>
The two main goals of the BeOS have always been—will always be --
efficiency and simplicity. But is it possible to present a 3D solution
that's both general and simple?
</p><p>
Frankly, no.
</p><p>
So if we can't have general simplicity, we'll choose "specific"
simplicity: The 3D Kit, our "from scratch" 3D API, is simple and
efficient, but it won't satisfy the furthest-out of the 3D innovators and
synthesizers. Of course, we don't want to abandon the experts; that's why
we've chosen to license OpenGL®.
</p><p>
So for professionals, our solution is OpenGL®; if you're just starting in
the 3D world, or if you're doing "light-weight" 3D modeling and
rendering, try the 3D Kit. In a future release, after we have OpenGL® up
and running, we'll work on providing some level of interaction between
the two, so that you'll be able to take advantage of the simplicity and
efficiency of the 3D Kit's API and still have access to the completeness
and generality of OpenGL®.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492940"></a>The 3D Kit Solution</h3></div></div></div><p>
The main goal of the 3D Kit is to provide a 3D API that's simple; we want
all programmers—particularly those that have never used 3D before --
to be able to incorporate 3D elements into their applications. That gives
us three main problems to solve:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Defining and designing three-dimensional objects (or "models"). This
is an extremely wide problem. Currently, if you want to design
something other than an elementary geometric figure you have to use an
expensive and complicated CAD program.
</p></li><li><p>
Breathing life into a 3D setting. After you've designed your objects,
you have to place them in a three-dimensional world. Your objects have
to be able to pass behind each other, bump into each other, bounce off
walls, and so on. And it has to look "natural" (if not necessarily
realistic).
</p></li><li><p>
Allowing the user to interact with your creation. The tools that the
user uses to interact with a 2D environment—the mouse and the
keyboard, primarily—need to be remapped to allow manipulations in
three dimensions. Teaching the user how to do this is difficult.
</p></li></ul><p>
Solving these problems asks for much more that just a 3D rendering
engine. Sticking with the BeOS philosophy of simplicity and efficiency,
we've chosen to provide "medium- end" native rendering that the
programmer can efficiently enliven and that the user can easily
manipulate, rather than a high-end engine that's difficult and sluggish.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id492996"></a>3D Kit Overview</h3></div></div></div><p>
The 3D Kit is written in C++ and is highly modular and expandable. The
basic elements of a 3D scene are separated into two categories,
represented by separate C++ classes:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The B3dBarrier class represents the static parts of the world, such
as walls, the ground, or more generally, any unmoving "stage" inside of
which the action takes place.
</p></li><li><p>
The B3dBody class represents the dynamic, movable objects—the
actors on the stage.
</p></li></ul><p>
The three main properties of a B3dBody are its geometrical description
(encapsulated in the B3dModel class), its appearance (the B3dLook class),
and the way its parts are connected to each other and to other objects
(the B3dLink class). Other properties can be added to a B3dBody, but
these three will be optimized.
</p><p>
The B3dBarrier and the B3dBody objects are the only "real" objects in a
3D scene (or B3dWorld). But you need more than that to create a world.
For example, you need the mathematical description of a light source that
will illuminate the scene (B3dLight), and a description of the angle and
distance from which you view the scene (B3dCamera). You can also use the
3D Kit to create "fake" objects (the B3dFakeBody), which are visible and
which the user can manipulate, but which aren't really there. For
example, you can use a B3dFakeBody to float a label near some "real"
B3dBody object.
</p><p>
All of the "things" that you create (bodies, cameras, lights, and so on
—objects that derive from the B3dThing class) are placed in a "world"
(B3dWorld). Most worlds can be described as one of three types of
environments:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The first type of environment is a "closed world" (B3dClosedWorld);
this is a closed space such as a room.
</p></li><li><p>
Then there is a world that has a ground but no walls or "ceiling":
The great outdoors, for example. We call this a "ground world"
(B3dGroundWorld).
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, there is the world without limits of any kind. Outer space.
This is the "etheric world" (B3dEthericWorld).
</p></li></ul><p>
There are many advantages to a strict definition of a world—the object
constructors are simpler and more efficient, the rendering engine can
make some cycle-saving assumptions. The main disadvantage of the
architecture is that you have to choose a world and stick with it. But
what if the world in your imagination is more complex than can be
described in a single B3dWorld object. For example, what world do you
choose if you want to place a little house (a closed world) on a prairie
(a ground world)?
</p><p>
Fortunately, while a world can't change after it's been created, you can
create more than one of them. Because the world isn't the biggest thing
in the ... world. The universe is.
</p><p>
The B3dUniverse can contain any number of B3dWorlds. Not only can you
have more than one world in your universe, you can define the interfaces
(or "doors", instances of B3dDoor) between the worlds. The door concept
is one of the most interesting parts of the 3D Kit; by connecting worlds
through doors rather than building one huge world, you can "distort" the
dimensions of the universe.
</p><p>
For example, imagine a door standing in the middle of a meadow. You open
the door and enter into a large room that connects to other rooms. You
walk back out into the meadow, close the door, and walk around to the
other side. All you see is the back of the door. You open the door from
this side and walk out onto a beach. The door acts like a science-fiction
teleporter that can move objects instantly from one B3dWorld to another.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id493102"></a>The 3D Kit in DR8</h3></div></div></div><p>
The 3D Kit is brand new in DR8, and so development hasn't advanced far.
Very few of the advanced features are implemented (no B3dDoors yet, for
example), and there will certainly be plenty of bugs. To help get you
started, we'll publish the source to a simple 3D demo application.
</p><p>
So please take the DR8 3D Kit for what it is: Enjoy it if you can, but
don't expect the world (OK, you'll get the world, but don't expect the
universe). We hope you understand better now why we're not just porting
one or two standard 3D APIs.
</p><p>
For more information on the 3D Kit, see the abovementioned white paper on
our web site. The paper looks at the 3D Kit's classes and rendering
engines in greater detail than allowed by this article.

Welcome to the 3D world!

To pay my way through college—and for fun—I've mostly done software
work. While at school (the University of Illinois at Champagne-Urbana) I
started to focus on hardware, both for a challenge and a change.
Currently, I do ASIC system-level simulation and design at S3 Inc. I'm
planning to go through some of the different chip and system-level
hardware design stuff and then make a decision about where to go next
(stay in it, go back to software, go to management, who knows).
</p><p>
Four years ago I started DCFG Software. Just two of us wrote, sold, and
supported multiline teleconferencing software called Gtalk. We didn't
sell tons of copies, nor did we make tons of money. However, both of
those factors were more limited by our commitment to staying and
finishing school than anything else. But when I have some spare time and
a project, I'll put it back together. When I get a project that looks
like it'll go somewhere big, I'll run with it.
</p><p>
In my spare time I work on several different free projects on the
internet. Recently that includes working on the VSTa microkernel
operating system (http://www.igcom.net/~jeske/VSTa/) and doing occasional
updates for a trackerized music file player (s3mod) that a friend of mine
and I wrote for UNIX platforms.
</p><p>
The BeBOX gets me going for a few reasons:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Symmetric Multiprocessing. I want to have an SMP machine on my desk.
Simple as that.
</p></li><li><p>
Newly Written OS. Because of compatibility issues, an aging OS will
run into limitations when trying to advance for the future. I'm willing
to accept throwing out all the old stuff to gain the benefit of
starting from something new.
</p></li><li><p>
The People. The folks at Be seem not only very excited and behind
what they themselves are doing, but they're also very in touch with
their developers (fans). It reminds me of everything I loved about the
direct lines of communication, feedback, and rapid product improvement
I experienced with my own startup.
</p></li></ul><p>
The first thing I'd like to do is to help improve the device support.
Specifically, I plan to write an S3 Trio 2D driver (Trio32/64+2d ViRGE
support). I also plan to put together a driver for the Gravis Ultrasound,
which I have experience coding for. In the slightly longer term, I'd also
love to put together a 3D driver for the up-and-coming 3D Kit and the S3
ViRGE 3D engine.
</p></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee1-35"></a>Strange Turns on the Way to the Port</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
This week we're announcing and demonstrating the availability of the BeOS
on Power Computing and PowerMac hardware. We like the retrospectively
obvious feel of the move, always a good sign. But I must admit it wasn't
always that clear. As usual, others thought of it before us: "I like the
multiprocessor idea, but I have this PowerMac, why can't I run your OS on
it, in monoprocessor mode?"
</p><p>
The idea was in the air. It would be nice to suggest we listened
thoughtfully, built consensus around the project, updated our mission
statement, revised the business plan, allocated resources, and carefully
scheduled the project. In fact, an external trigger precipitated the
whole process.
</p><p>
The last Friday before Apple's May '96 developers' conference, around 3
pm, a voice-mail message told us we couldn't show the BeBox in the
exhibits section. This was four months after we'd received and accepted
an invitation to buy exhibit space. It turned out be a misunderstanding,
quickly and courteously cleared up after the weekend. But in the
meantime, a few minutes after we received the message, the PowerMac port
was conceived. We were not Macintosh developers, said the message. Let's
quickly port the BeOS to a PowerMac, suggested Bob Herold, one of our
founding engineers. We had to have a name for the project. Our VP of
Engineering, Erich Ringewald, came up with the winner: OS Doubler.
</p><p>
After the conference, our friends at Power Computing offered to lend us
hardware and technical support. Later, Apple executives and hardware
engineers provided very useful technical data. After two and a half
months of work, the port works nicely on Power Computing and PowerMac
systems. From the very beginning of the company, Bob Herold has been in
charge of the lowest layer of the system, where software interacts with
the minutest details of the hardware. He led the 1994 port from the AT&amp;T
Hobbit processor to the PowerPC. This time again, working with Dominic
Giampaolo, Pierre Raynaud-Richard, Brad Taylor, Marc Ferguson, and other
members of the Be software team, Bob led the project to a successful and
timely completion. Good team, good work, you'll say—but what does it
mean?
</p><p>
First, for Be developers, the space for their applications is no longer
contained by Be hardware. It would be imprudent to advance lofty
projections at this stage, but MacWorld will give us an early indication
of acceptance in the Mac community.
</p><p>
For users, it is a low-risk opportunity to get acquainted with our OS.
You lose multiprocessing and Be's richer and less-expensive PC clone
organ bank I/O, but you can always buy a BeBox later. Or, if you want to
run the BeOS on a portable computer, you don't have to hire a personal
trainer while you wait for the portable BeBox.
</p><p>
For the informal PowerPC alliance, the benefits are less easy to assess.
The broader availability of a fresh, high- performance MP OS might assist
with the protracted birth of a really unified hardware platform, the
equivalent of the PC/AT in the Intel world. As we've often said, once
such a reference platform really firms up, we'll be on it in no time, and
we'll be happy to collaborate on the definition of MP extensions. Some
Power Computing systems have a slot for a second processor; we'll see how
we can make good use of it in the meantime.
</p><p>
For us (here we enter a delicate area), this port gives us a good
benchmark for the performance of our system software. The hardware
variable is removed. As a result, it becomes easier to see the
performance and programming advantages of the BeOS.
</p><p>
We still have much to do and much to prove. We have to verify the quality
of the port before we start charging for it. The BeOS itself needs more
work and more evangelizing among developers. And we'll have to deal with
questions such as: Are we getting out of the hardware business? The
answer to that one is easy: No. We do provide competitive MP and I/O-rich
solutions at the low end of the price range and, for lack of system
software, no one seems to be interested in building four-processor 604
digital media screamers. We are. Other questions don't have easy answers
yet. Such as integrating or encapsulating the Mac OS. Nonetheless, this
is a good, pleasant step in expanding our horizons and we're grateful for
the little push we received last February.

More (but not much) on MIME's hierarchical file types. How about MIME
for e-mail messages but not for files on disk? The proposed reason: To
avoid the MIME overhead. It was countered that there is no MIME
overhead (or need not be, anyway).

The proposed CPU "snooze" mode is (once again) frowned upon.

An answer to last week's question ("Is RDB prone to viruses?"): No more
than any other boot sequence that pulls data in from all over. This
expanded into a more general discussion of security; if the BeBox is
primarily a "multimedia tool," should the security be as tight as for,
say, a general workstation. The "tool" assertion rubbed some folks the
wrong way: The BeBox is more than a real-time audio/video streamer.
</p><p>
Also, automounting: Can/should the BeOS autodetect a new CD (for
example)? Does CDPlayer (which has some form of autodetection) poll?
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: CDPlayer polls SCSI CD-ROM drives to detect a new disk. In
DR8, the Browser will do the same. In both cases, the polling frequency
is quite low.

The question "How do you discover whether a font is a bitmap or an
outline?" turned into a larger discussion of the Be character set.
Should it be ISO-Latin-1? Unicode? A list of attributes for an ideal
font system was offered.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id493472"></a>Subject: Printing and Stuff...</h4></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="subtitle">
A/K/A: Imaging Model<br />
A/K/A: The Math of Graphics
</h5></div></div></div><p>
What should the imaging model be? PostScript is on the tips of tens of
tongues—but there's a lot of hesitancy about actually spitting out
the name. In theory, most folks would like to have the flexibility and
power of a PostScript imaging back-end, but what would the cost be,
both in speed and dollars (as in licensing from Adobe)?
</p><p>
Soon after the thread was renamed "Imaging model," someone breathed
"rotation" and we were off to 3D matrix land, thus betraying the new
name. It was urgently hoped that the 3D Kit would use 4D matrices in
which to compose 3D transformations.
</p><p>
We also got an overview of the "Continuum Hypothesis," an unprovable
(and so highly devtalk-appropriate) mathematical theory.
</p><p>
THE BE LINE: Pierre Reynaud-Richard (author of the 3D Kit) dashed the
4D transformation matrix hopes—the Kit uses 3D matrices. Although
the 4D matrix is a convenient notation, 3D composition is less
expensive, particularly on a single FPU machine. (However, if you add
dedicated 3D/FPU/array processing hardware, the game changes.)

Should Be adopt OpenDoc (and SOM)? Folks responded with an emphatic and
nearly uncontested "Yes." There was some rumbling about the size and
(slow) speed of OpenDoc systems (CyberDog in particular); also, it was
opined that a good OpenDoc port would take at least a year. Would CORBA
be faster (both porting and running)?

The MIME, 4-byte file type, document/application assignation debate
comes back to life.

Discussions on the proposed multiple-user BeOS; specifically, how
should network access be handled? Is inetd (or something like it)
possible in an environment where sockets aren't inherited? The subject
of network security was raised and branched into cryptography, ITAR,
and whether it's better to be a criminal in the US or in France.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id493569"></a>Subject: Multiheaded BeOS and Down with the Network Computer</h4></div></div></div><p>
A call for mulitple monitors (and keyboards and mice) per single BeBox.
This led to a more general discussion of how the hardware would need to
change to support such a thing. FireWire was requested.
