In a previous column (Issue 1-13), I wrote about the various ways to send
data on the BeBox. In another column (Issue 1-4), I talked about the
dangers of race conditions and deadlocks, problems inherent in a
multithreaded OS. Now I'd like to bring these two topics together and
talk about the differences between posting messages through <code class="classname">BLooper</code>'s
<code class="methodname">PostMessage()</code>, and sending messages through
<code class="classname">BMessenger</code>'s <code class="methodname">SendMessage()</code>.
</p><p>
Posting a message is simple. Given a pointer to a <code class="classname">BLooper</code> object, you
simply invoke <code class="methodname">PostMessage()</code> upon that object, passing a
<code class="classname">BMessage</code> object
as an argument. A subtlety here is that this implies that you're holding
onto a pointer: Most programmers remember learning about the dangers of
pointers. Once you have a pointer to an object, you're tempted to do
other things with that pointer, like dereference it to access a data
member, or call some virtual function. Unless the code properly locks and
unlocks the object, either of these actions can lead to an immediate,
abrupt, and unpleasant suspension of further computation! (Check out the
"Be Newsletter," Issue 1-4, for more details.)
</p><p>
An alternative is to use <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>'s <code class="methodname">SendMessage()</code> function. Prior to
DR7, <code class="classname">BMessenger</code> objects could only refer to <code class="classname">BApplication</code> objects. In DR7,
a <code class="classname">BMessenger</code> can refer to any <code class="classname">BHandler</code> (in other words, any object that
can receive a message). This is an obvious boon to interapplication
communication and, interestingly enough, it also provides a new way to do
intra-application messaging. Instead of saving a pointer to a <code class="classname">BHandler</code>,
you can create a <code class="classname">BMessenger</code> that represents that object. Using
<code class="methodname">SendMessage()</code> to communicate with a <code class="classname">BHandler</code> is completely safe. Plus,
there are no pointers involved so the temptations are minimized.
</p><p>
Now let's consider "safe locking": The safe locking of pointers is pretty
safe, but it does contain a hole. Suppose you have a pointer to a <code class="classname">BWindow</code>
and you call <code class="methodname">Lock()</code>. <code class="methodname">Lock()</code>
will return <code class="constant">FALSE</code> if the object no longer
exists. Now suppose just before calling <code class="methodname">Lock()</code> the <code class="classname">BWindow</code> was destroyed
and a new <code class="classname">BWindow</code> was created and, furthermore, suppose the new object is
allocated at the same memory location as the old object. In this case
<code class="methodname">Lock()</code> will return <code class="constant">TRUE</code>.
The new window will be locked, even though, in
the semantics of the code, the old window was the target of the <code class="methodname">Lock()</code>
call. What happens after this is anyone's guess.
</p><p>
With <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>s this can't happen. A <code class="classname">BMessenger</code> to an object is unique
for the life of the application. Memory addresses or pointers, on the
other hand, can be recycled. This makes using <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>s and avoiding
pointers the safest way to go. The style of coding that I'm suggesting
might look something like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting cpp">
<code class="classname">TMyApp</code>::<code class="methodname">TMyApp</code>()
{
   <span class="type"><code class="classname">TMyWindow</code> *</span><code class="varname">w</code> = new <code class="classname">TMyWindow</code>(...);

   <span class="comment">// Instead of saving the window pointer,</span>
   <span class="comment">// you save a messenger to the window:</span>
   <code class="varname">fWindowM</code> = <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>(<code class="varname">w</code>);

   <code class="classname">TMainView</code> *<code class="varname">main_view</code> = new <code class="classname">TMainView</code>(...);

   <span class="comment">// Similarly for the view:</span>
   <code class="varname">fMainViewM</code> = <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>(<code class="varname">main_view</code>);

   <code class="varname">w</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">AddChild</code>(<code class="varname">main_view</code>);

   ...
}
</pre><p>
In the example the application object uses the <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>s to communicate
with the <code class="classname">BWindow</code> and <code class="classname">BView</code>.
If one of these objects (the <code class="classname">BWindow</code> or
<code class="classname">BView</code>) is deleted, the corresponding
<code class="classname">BMessenger</code> will report an error the
next time it's used. In this way the holder of the messenger is safely
informed of its cohort's demise.
</p><p>
Another benefit of <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>s is that they have built-in support for
replies. If you post a message to another object in your application,
there's no way that you can reply to that post. However, with every
<code class="methodname">SendMessage</code> comes an automatic return address. So for every message
that's sent, the receiver can do a <code class="methodname">SendReply()</code>. This can be a useful tool.
</p><p>
The downside to <code class="classname">BMessenger</code>s is that they're more expensive than pointers:
A pointer is only 4 bytes, a <code class="classname">BMessenger</code> is 16.
Also, <code class="methodname">PostMessage()</code> is
currently faster than <code class="methodname">SendMessage()</code>. And of course, sending a message is
significantly more expensive than simply accessing some data or calling a
function. If some set of objects is tightly coupled, then using
<code class="classname">BMessenger</code>s might not be the right solution given the performance penalty.
</p><p>
Here's another programming tip that makes use of the messaging system.
We've received some feedback indicating that our framework forces
frequent subclassing in order to extend functionality. I'm not denying
that the framework is so oriented, but there are some nice ways to avoid
this problem. One example is when one window (let's call it the "document
window") wants to open a dialog box asking the user for some input. Let's
say this dialog has two views: An input text field and a "Do It" button.
</p><p>
At first glance it seems like you have to subclass <code class="classname">BWindow</code> to process the
message posted by the "Do It" button. However, there's another way that
doesn't require any subclassing. The document window creates the dialog
window and adds the two views. The document then calls
<code class="methodname">BControl::SetTarget()</code> on the button, making itself the target of the
button. Even though the button lives in the dialog box, the message it
sends when clicked will go to the document window. Finally the dialog is
displayed and the document window goes on its merry way. Now, when the
user clicks the "Do It" button a message is sent to the document window.
From this message the document can get the button, dialog, and any other
information in the dialog. So once it extracts all necessary information,
it tells the dialog to close. End of story. You get a nice little dialog
without any subclassing (except, of course, for the document window
itself, which must be a subclass of <code class="classname">BWindow</code>).
</p><p>
The <code class="methodname">SetTarget()</code> functions in <code class="classname">BControl</code>,
<code class="classname">BMenuItem</code>, and <code class="classname">BListView</code> are very
useful—give them a try.

From the day he first read about the BeBox, Sean Allen, partner and
programmer at Infant Software, was hooked. “<span class="quote">I wrote to Be and asked if
the $1,500 price tag was a typo—they said no. That price, that power,
a built-in database, multithreaded, preemptive multitasking: Geek love!</span>”
Sean thought it was rather fitting that his BeBox arrived on Valentine's
Day.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">With the right marketing, the BeBox can explode. I expect the machine to
grab large chunks of market share over the next few years. It will gobble
up the NeXT and Amiga camps, video and MIDI markets look ripe too, and it
would make a killer DTP machine. Once people experience a BeBox and see
the price, converts are easy.</span>”
</p><p>
Not only does Sean see market potential for the BeBox, Infant Software, a
four-person company that develops custom CGIs (Common Gateway
Interfaces), databases, and free/shareware, is betting its future on Be:
“<span class="quote">We've decided to forgo our current platforms (Macintosh and UNIX) and be
a Be-only company. We want to carve out our ground now and be there with
one of the tractor application when the BeBox explodes.</span>”
</p><p>
Sean and his partners are working on a modular suite of Web tools, which
use the <span class="trademark">Be OS</span>™ database to share information. Modules include a web
server, a visitor tracker, an API for CGI-type work, and game modules.
They plan to publish their messaging API so anyone can write a module
that will work with their tools.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">We believe everybody has the right to the basic tools to make their
computers useful, so we'll make our core tools available for free. We'll
only charge for add-ons, like the visitor tracker.</span>” They anticipate
releasing the first tools in the first quarter of 1997, followed by
additional modules, such as a software metering API, various distributed
network applications (including games), and "agent" software.
</p><p>
Unlike other platforms he's developed for, Sean says, “<span class="quote">I feel like I
really have a chance to put my stamp on the Be OS—to help shape it, to
help it grow. Developers really matter to Be, and that's a refreshing
change.</span>”
</p><p>
What's more, the BeBox is fun to program: The Be OS is 100 times easier
to program than the Mac OS, 500 times easier than Windows, and 75 times
easier than UNIX. That means shorter development times, better products,
fewer bugs, and more time to dream, design, and build incredible software.
</p><p>
“<span class="quote">I am, quite simply, in love with this machine.</span>”

We get many inquiries concerning employment opportunities at Be. With
these inquiries come questions regarding the company's style and
philosophy in such matters: What's it like working at a start-up such as
Be? What sort of individuals are we looking for? We'll skip the usual
meaningless platitudes: Honest, hard-working, creative, intelligent...
(Of course we admire these qualities—but when was the last time you
saw a resume that extolled the candidate's exemplary uncreativeness,
sloth, and dishonesty?)
</p><p>
Let's proceed by comparison, then. In many large companies, the
"product," at the work-a-day level, is broken down into "projects."
Individual projects get sliced and diced into manageable components, and
the components are parceled out to individuals according to their
specialized training and experience. To coordinate the project
components, you need project management; a premium is placed on
management's ability to orchestrate, adjudicate, and focus the blindered
energy that emanates from a line of wall-facing cubicles. A significant
amount of time, money, and emotion are spent not in crafting the project
itself, but in crafting the crafting of the project: In the careful
placement of the walls between the compartments, and the minutiae of
passing data over these walls. And this is just to mention the lowest
level of management.
</p><p>
At Be, we hire people, not projects. Of course, we have certain tasks
that we want to accomplish, and we have, at times, targeted prospective
employees because of very specific talents. But, in general, we want
individuals whose personalities and training make them comfortable with
an environment where they're expected to grasp the whole concept, find a
niche (or a canyon) that needs filling, and then start digging. We want
to create an environment where the biggest chunk of any particular
problem (be it engineering, marketing, manufacturing, finance...) resides
inside a single human head. No turf wars, no miscommunication, and no
layers of management.
</p><p>
This is an approach that only a small company can take—and if Be is
going to win, we must take this approach in order to turn our size to our
advantage. To the other guys, we look like ants; but from our
perspective, they look like lumbering, graceless dinosaurs.
</p><p>
Another important trait that we expect in our employees is that they have
a clear sense of the business purpose of their own actions. It's not
enough that they think that they're providing a valuable service, or,
worse, that they simply take marketing's word for it—they must know
why it's important. In most cases, they should even know the names of the
developers that their work will benefit most. At Be, "because marketing
asked for it" is simply not an acceptable answer.
</p><p>
We want engineers to act upon their own estimation of what their clients
will want, like, and pay for. We expect a similar understanding of the
business across the entire organization. Now, what kind of Human
Resources organization do we have to ensure this shared awareness of and
commitment to the common purpose? None.
</p><p>
Most of us have observed the damage caused by addictive HR organizations.
In the beginning, they relieve stress. Soon, they insinuate themselves
into every aspect of corporate life and withdrawal pain becomes
impossible to bear. Not unlike some welfare programs, HR becomes an end
unto itself, a means of existence for a group of individuals whose
sustenance depends upon their clients' problems. Decisions are laden with
their intervention. Straight- forward processes are gummed up with their
arbitration.
</p><p>
In a way, HR is a protection racket. A process must be put in place, a
study must be made, a task force must be set up; thus management is
protected and absolved of political responsibility, and HR gains power.
</p><p>
One of the benefits we offer at Be is that there's no HR and there won't
be any. Personnel, yes. Forms, benefits, insurance, 401K—these are all
healthy and regular paperwork movements. If we ever need HR work, we'll
bring consultants to help. And then they'll leave. Just as we want our
employees to own their work, so do we want an unobfuscated (and minimal)
management to be fully responsible for its actions.
</p><p>
As for turnover: On a small sample size such as ours (population 30)
statistics don't tell much. We've consistently lost two or three people
every year. Our goal is to detect an ill-fit between the individual and
the mission as early as possible. One of the benefits of early detection
is a more amiable parting of the ways before frustration and bitterness
set in. So far, it seems to have worked: One ex-engineer even treated the
entire company to (good) pizza to help celebrate the BeBox intro. Another
helped us recruit a new employee at a crucial juncture. But enough syrup;
the bottom line is that we can only succeed if we continue to attract and
hire a (small) number of mature, broad-minded, self-reliant individuals.
</p><p>
To be an efficient guerilla-type company, we need the kind of
professionals who seek and will contribute to maintain such an
environment. You can come from a large company, or be straight out of
college: It doesn't really matter as long as you fit the environment
you're in charge of creating.
