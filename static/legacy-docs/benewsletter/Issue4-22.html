The testing labs here are Be are running full steam ahead and the
espresso machine is working overtime to keep us wired and on task. Here's
a run down of release day nightmares that we work to prevent. As
developers, you can take this frightening tale and brew your own testing
procedures.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id788740"></a>That's funny, it works on my machine...</h3></div></div></div><p>
Yes, we've all had that terrible feeling of bringing a stable and
beautiful product over to a friend's house (or to a demo) and watching
our audience's eyes glaze over when it konks in "working" code and we
fumble to try it again. A different video driver, a slower net
connection, or less <acronym class="acronym">RAM</acronym> can lead to unexpected and embarrassing crashes.
</p><p>
To deal with this at Be, we've created two labs that regularly ferret out
differences in seemingly similar platforms. In our main lab we have racks
of OEM systems set up for automated testing. Our testing server can
deploy test scripts in wondrous and sometimes evil combinations, which
turn up fun facts (like sleep mode on Thinkpads does terrible things to
our sound output and shutdown on a quad zeon can be tricky). When media
testing is in full effect, you can walk down the aisles and watch
"Clueless," hear the entire White Album, and see Input Recorder
controlling paint programs that save to network drives that are
compressed and copied a thousand times from <acronym class="acronym">IDE</acronym>
to <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym>. Combinations of
applications and weeks of duress shouldn't cause a crash. Period.
</p><p>
In our other lab, which I refer to as the Ark, we keep one or two of
every card, motherboard, peripheral, processor, and hard drive type that
we support. With the speed of cheetahs we can set up almost any system to
reproduce developer submitted bugs. This is also where we perform some of
the pre-release sanity checks. For example, every motherboard in the Ark
is set up to use the same interrupt for all pci slots, and then every
driver is run through its paces while other drivers generate traffic on
the bus. We swap out a card, reboot, run the tests, file any bugs, and
move on. The BeOS makes this easy, but I shudder to think what it would
be like on other platforms. How many times have I seen the "Found new
hardware, insert installation CD" message on the BeOS? Not once.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id788777"></a>CrashMe.avi</h3></div></div></div><p>
Media standards are as flexible as flea market prices at closing time. If
an application can read the media that it writes, it will often try to
pass itself off as standards compliant. Fortunately, the BeOS team thinks
that media we create should also be usable on other operating systems, so
we spend time trolling the Internet for strangely formatted media and we
use industry nonstandard applications to create kooky versions of
"virtual (void)." We keep an internal server of strange files, and before
every release we run through them all to make certain that they still
sound and look as they should. We take media created on the BeOS and play
it on other operating systems. Does that sound editor that you just wrote
handle zero- length sounds? Can that video sequencer fade from black to
an all-white video still and create a portable media file?
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id788788"></a>A Testing Fairy Tale</h3></div></div></div><p>
Two test engineers were in a crunch. The floppy drive they were currently
testing would work all day while they ran a variety of stress tests, but
the exact same tests would run for only eight hours at night. After a few
days of double-checking the hardware, the testing procedure, and the
recording devices, they decided to stay the night and watch what
happened. For eight hours they stared at the floppy drive and drank
espresso. The long dark night slowly turned into day and the sun shone in
the window. The angled sunlight triggered the write-protection mechanism,
which caused a write failure. A new casing was designed and the problem
was solved. Who knew?
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id788799"></a>I Heart rand()</h3></div></div></div><p>
A silent sound sample is an example of an edge case, where everything is
correct but a bit extreme. Does Tracker drag more than 1024 files to the
desktop? Does the Network Kit handle four days of varying speed ftp
transfers? Can you drag and drop a file around the desktop for three
hours? We watch the heap, we make sure Pulse doesn't peg out, and we
double check that the BeOS can hang with the weirdos. Does your
application handle a thousand screaming monkeys pounding their way
towards Hamlet?
</p><p>

Updating your application for the new release? Trying to add some polish
and shine because you want to start charging money for it? Well, in this
very busy time before the release, I wanted to share some information on
a few simple items that can make your application—and the BeOS in
general—the best that it can be.
</p><p>
What follows are the top five interaction and interface issues that
plague me and the software using public in general. Some are common to
every platform, others are unique to the BeOS. While you read, think
about how you accomplish tasks that involve these issues, then send me
your comments.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id788866"></a>Modality—"Are you sure?"</h3></div></div></div><p>
Not all questions and interactions deserve a user's undivided attention.
One of the most frustrating things about software is when it limits you
needlessly. Granted, modal interaction is required in some situations,
but too often it's used only out of convenience to the programmer. To
take the Mac OS as an example, it has always had modal file panels. This
is no doubt an artifact of the way that the system worked long ago, but
it has little or no technological basis today. The person who create that
panel thought it would be great to lock the user into using it, and
eliminate the need to check for changes in the file system or other nasty
conditions. For users this is just another example of the computer
prompting you for information and then not letting you use the system
until it gets an answer.
</p><p>
Need I even mention that this is bad? If modality is used just to call
attention to something, I think that color and positioning are preferable
to modal blocking. If modality is used because the application can't
handle changes to settings and interaction with the application, then you
should explore the idea of having "always saved" so that changes are
immediate. I urge everyone to explore ways to avoid stacking windows on
top of each other within your own apps, allowing users to position things
in their own environment.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id788881"></a>Language—"Don't do what 'Johnny Don't' does!"</h3></div></div></div><p>
The Simpsons quote sums this item up nicely. Just because the words and
phrasing you use are technically correct—or make sense to you --
doesn't mean that everyone else will understand them. Software usability
is often sacrificed through the use of improper language. Software often
presents controls and information in a language that users don't speak.
The first example that comes to mind is the word "default." Although this
word wasn't created in the computer industry, it's found a home there.
"Default" may mean something very specific to engineers, but may have
various meanings to the general public. We should hesitate to use such
words in the interface. Finding clear and concise wording is difficult
and may take several attempts before the right solution is found. It pays
off though, if people can understand your program because wording in the
interface is well placed and informative.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id788893"></a>Feedback—"Please wait..."</h3></div></div></div><p>
Everyone knows by now that giving feedback to the user during various
application operations is important. I realize that the BeOS we may put
application developers in a difficult situation. What I mean is, why
would you tell users the system is busy when at any one point in time,
the system is still responsive to their interaction? This is exactly why
we don't use the "busy" cursor. Cursor feedback is a great device for
quick and easy user notification, but we don't want to use it in the same
way as other operating systems. If you are using cursor feedback, it
should be to expose different items of interaction as the mouse cursor
moves over them. Showing when you're on a particular guide, what type of
paintbrush you're using, when you're on the resize corner—these are
all situations for employing informative cursors.
</p><p>
In the BeOS an hourglass or a watch cursor would hinder using the cursor
to select other items and continue working. So what should we do instead?
System feedback should come in the form of in-place notification. Let's
take, for instance, a list in your application that needs to be sorted;
while the list is being sorted, place a status indicator where the listed
items would normally be. This avoids using modal alerts, which I believe
said we should all use less of. I realize that putting a progress bar or
even a text string in the panel might be more difficult than simply
changing the cursor, or popping up an alert, but it's a more elegant and
useful way to solve this problem that allows users to keep working and
interacting with other parts of the system.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id788907"></a>Consistency—"That which we call a rose by any other name would smell
as sweet."</h3></div></div></div><p>
Repeat after me: Consistency is not the Holy Grail of interface. When two
buttons look different, they can interact differently, but if they look
similar, then they should behave the similarly. I urge developers not to
make their applications sterile with conformity, but to remain consistent
with their form language as well as their interaction behaviors. There
isn't just one solution to this problem, but any time you override the
behavior of a control, or load extra functionality onto an existing
control, think twice about what you're doing and consider using your own
custom parts to meet your particular needs.
</p><p>
Errors - "An unknown application has experienced an unknown error
(#0032)."
</p><p>
You've seen messages like this before. When running beta software, I
expect to get errors and alerts that tell me things I don't understand.
These messages are meant for the programmers and I faithfully quote these
messages back to the originators of the software. But—when I'm using
commercial software, or even shareware/freeware, I don't expect to need
my decoder ring to find out what my computer is trying to tell me.
Sometimes I can understand that the application might not have enough
information to render a useful message, but I see incomprehensible
messages more often than helpful ones. If your app quits because it
couldn't find a library, tell me which one. If you crash when you're out
of memory, tell me to buy more. If you don't know what happened, tell me
that you don't know! And don't tell me it's my fault that something has
gone wrong. In fact, I like my software to be apologetic and polite, but
most software is not. This is strongly related to the language issue,
because errors should be explained in my language.
</p><p>
This list could be longer, but I thought I'd leave you with these five
issues. I hope you can use them to make your applications better, raising
the value of your own software, and making using the BeOS a better
experience. Remember, it's a complex task to make things simple.

You've seen a full-featured and glorious example of a Media Kit consumer
node, the LoggingConsumer, but what about producer nodes? There are an
awful lot of pure-virtual methods declared in the <code class="classname">BBufferProducer</code> class;
what do they all do? And how do you deal with producer nodes in your
applications?
</p><p>
We in DTS are painfully aware of this dearth of <code class="classname">BBufferProducer</code> examples.
But behold—a new node has arisen that highlights and explains the
sundry pitfalls of buffer production in the BeOS Media Kit. It generates
pure tones (with parameters for frequency, amplitude, and waveform, of
course), reacts properly to difficulties in node delivery, and is
generally a model Media Kit citizen.
</p><p>
Before I discuss certain details of its operation, here's the URL, so you
can follow along at home.
</p><p>
&lt;ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/samples/media_kit/ToneProducer.zip&gt;
</p><p>
Now then, where were we? Ah, yes: buffer production.
</p><p>
As recommended by everyone remotely involved with the Genki Media Kit,
<code class="classname">ToneProducer</code> is based on the new <code class="classname">BMediaEventLooper</code> class, which
enormously simplifies node implementation. There are a few topics still
left to the node author, however; here's how <code class="classname">ToneProducer</code> deals with
them, and how you might deal with them in your own nodes.
</p><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id789029"></a>Do You Speak My Language?</h3></div></div></div><p>
The first major area that node writers must grapple with is data format
negotiation. When two nodes are connected, they go through a multi-step
"conversation" to determine what data format to use. <code class="classname">ToneProducer</code>'s
format negotiations are relatively simple: the node only produces 44.1
KHz floating-point raw audio, so the only wild card subject to
negotiation is the buffer size.
</p><p>
The format negotiation process uses three <code class="classname">BBufferProducer</code> methods, in
this order: <code class="methodname">FormatProposal()</code>, <code class="methodname">PrepareToConnect()</code>, and <code class="methodname">Connect()</code>. The
producer initiates the whole process in <code class="methodname">FormatProposal()</code>, proposing its
"favorite" format, with wild cards indicating aspects of the media format
where variation is acceptable. When <code class="methodname">PrepareToConnect()</code> is called, the
consumer has been given an opportunity to adjust the proposed format to
meet *its* needs. At this point, the producer must ensure that the format
is still acceptable, and reserve the connection if it is. This is done by
choosing the connection's source and destination, and remembering them in
whatever cache structure the node chooses to use. Finally, <code class="methodname">Connect()</code> is
called—the end of the dialog. At this point the producer is not
permitted to fail; the connection was "guaranteed" by a successful return
code from <code class="methodname">PrepareToConnect()</code>.
</p><p>
From an application's viewpoint, by the way, the source and destination
IDs that represent the connection are subject to change within the Media
Roster's <code class="methodname">Connect()</code> method. Don't try to save the free media input and
media output records that your app found before calling <code class="methodname">Connect()</code>—they
might well be invalid after <code class="classname">BMediaRoster</code>::<code class="methodname">Connect()</code> returns!
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id789120"></a>Where Do I Put My Data?</h3></div></div></div><p>
The second major topic for node writers is buffer management. Implicit in
the Media Kit API are such interesting questions as "How many buffers do
I need in my buffer group?" and "How exactly do I timestamp buffers,
anyway?" Some of these questions are more complex than they first appear.
</p><p>
For example, the number of buffers to allocate in a node's buffer group
depends on how long the buffered data will take to reach its eventual
destination. After all, if there aren't enough buffers, the producer will
be unable to send some data because all the buffers in its group are
floating downstream! The usual heuristic for buffer allocation,
therefore, is to use enough buffers to completely account for the node's
downstream latency, plus one. Because of rounding effects, the formula
for this is (downstream latency / buffer duration + 2).
</p><p>
Buffer timestamps are subtle. The first rule is "always work in
performance time." Real time (that is, what <code class="function">system_time()</code> or
<code class="classname">BTimeSource</code>::<code class="methodname">RealTime()</code> say) is never in sync with other hardware clocks
such as audio cards, so trying to reconcile the two is doomed to failure.
The second rule is that buffer timestamps should always be recalculated
from a remembered start time, based on the amount of media (number of
samples or frames) delivered so far. Recalculating from scratch for each
buffer avoids cumulative drift that arises from trying to use a
precalculated buffer duration.
</p><p>
And this isn't all: other nodes can request that you use *their* buffers,
not your own. Your producer should be prepared to handle this case; see
the example code for the recommended way to do so. It's pretty
straightforward; the only thing to remember is this: make sure you delete
your buffer group when you're finished. Failure to do so can leave your
buffers orphaned in other parts of the system, which tends to cause
<span class="trademark">Bad Things</span>™ to happen.
</p><p>
Finally, producer nodes have a <code class="methodname">SetOutputEnabled()</code> method, which acts like
a mute button. When output is disabled, the producer sends no buffers
downstream. However, just as your CD player keeps spinning while muted,
so your producer should continue winding through its data in real time
even when output is disabled. Keep this in mind when deciding exactly
when to consume the source media, and whether to send buffers
downstream....
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id789193"></a>Tell Me How To....</h3></div></div></div><p>
The third major topic for node writers is parameterization, the mechanism
that lets the user (or other programs) change the node's behavior at run
time. There are some vagaries of the <code class="classname">BParameterWeb</code> mechanism that bear
mentioning, lest everyone make the same mistakes over and over again
while learning how to work with the Media Kit.
</p><p>
First, don't allocate a <code class="classname">BParameterWeb</code> in your node's constructor.
Comments in the Be header files in earlier OS releases notwithstanding,
this is *not* the appropriate place to do so. The node's connection to
the Media Roster is necessary to the parameter-handling process, and that
connection doesn't exist while the node is being constructed. Instead,
set up your parameter web in your node's <code class="methodname">NodeRegistered()</code> method, which
is called immediately after the Media Roster is informed of the node's
existence.
</p><p>
Finally, nodes never have to delete their parameter webs. The
<code class="methodname">SetParameterWeb()</code> method deletes the previous web for you, and the
<code class="classname">BControllable</code> node destructor deletes whatever web is active at the time.
Between these two methods, your node never needs to worry about deleting
its web.
</p><p>
Applications are another matter. While it's true that the Media Roster's
<code class="methodname">ViewFor()</code> method takes ownership of the web, and deletes it when the view
is disposed of, the application is responsible for deleting the web
itself in all other cases.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id789259"></a>But Wait—There's More!</h3></div></div></div><p>
Err, well, actually there isn't any more. There are still two things that
<code class="classname">ToneProducer</code> doesn't handle yet: offline mode
and <code class="methodname">SetPlayRate()</code>. Both of
these are somewhat intricate, and are being held in abeyance for a future
newsletter article. The fact that I sacrificed the Memorial Day holiday
weekend to *this* article might have something to do with it as well.
</p><p>
So there you have it: a thorough, profusely documented producer node. Now
get out there and write your own already!
</p></div></div><hr class="pagebreak" /><div class="sect1"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="Gassee4-22"></a>A Crack in the Wall: Part II</h2></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author">By <span class="firstname">Jean-Louis</span> <span class="surname">Gassée</span></span></div></div></div><p>
Some time ago, I wrote a semi-fictional column regarding the plight of
the CEO of a PC clone company ("<a class="xref" href="Issue4-8.html#Gassee4-8" title="A Crack in the Wall">A Crack in the Wall</a>." At a
quarterly business review for Wall Street analysts, the CEO extolled his
vision: Giving buyers more OS choices was A Good Thing. Everything went
well—customers loved having Linux and the BeOS installed on their
system at the factory, next to the classic Windows. The out-of-the-box
experience was great, the options at boot time were easily understood
and, since customers could delete the system(s) they didn't want to keep,
this was the real thing, freedom of choice—without waste. The PC
magazines loved the move, we reaped all the Best Of... awards and
generated good will and oodles of free publicity.
</p><p>
Ah, another thing, the CEO continued. The company lost $50 million
dollars this quarter because Microsoft fined us for offering other
operating systems. Their contract with us gives them the right to
increase the price we effectively pay for Windows if we offer other
operating systems. Microsoft even invoked an obscure—and confidential
-- clause in their licensing agreement and grumbled that we had no right
to use their boot manager, or any DOS code, to load other operating
systems. It's OK for the customer to install a boot manager him/herself,
but you, the PC OEM shouldn't. As a result, they claim we shouldn't offer
the of out-of-the-box experience I mentioned earlier. Some customer
assembly is required.

At this stage, the CEO has lost his audience—and his job.
</p><p>
As I said at the beginning, this is a concoction. But testimony is
sometimes tastier than what amateur columnists can dream up. What we have
before us is a deposition by Garry Norris, an IBM executive and a
government witness in the antitrust suit against Microsoft. In his
testimony, Garry Norris describes how Microsoft quintupled the Windows
royalties it demanded from IBM, to $220 million. There is some dispute
about the exact numbers, but you get the idea.
</p><p>
How the media treated this is noteworthy. One title read "IBM breaks
ranks..." This appears to reflect a commonly held belief: PC OEMs didn't
want to break a code of silence for fear of some kind of retaliation. In
private, PC OEMs "share their thoughts" quite freely. They appear to
resent being treated as vassals by Microsoft in its use or abuse of its
desktop OS monopoly. In public, they have to take care of business. Who
can blame them? Business is competitive enough as it is. Why risk a
falling out with Microsoft that will result in a competitive
disadvantage? As far as we know, there is no Antitrust Witness Protection
Program, so the tension between self-interest and the calculus of common
good is understandable.
</p><p>
This leads to another thought: Why IBM? Is this an example of the
altruism of an enlightened corporation, or have they decided they no
longer have anything to lose in the PC business, as various rumors have
intimated in the past few months? There has been speculation—and
denials—that IBM wanted out of the PC business, because it has become
too commoditized and it's been impossible for them to make a profit. Some
have even read something of that nature in their multi-year, multibillion
dollar agreement with Dell.
</p><p>
Whatever IBM's reason for breaking the code of silence, their testimony
could make this phase of the trial as surprise-filled as the first one.
