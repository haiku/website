This section discusses the framework in which <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>s draw. Detailed
descriptions of the functions mentioned here can be found in the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> and <a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a> class descriptions.
</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_View_Geometry"></a>View Geometry</h3></div></div></div><p>
Each view is assigned a coordinate system of its own. By default, the
coordinate origin—(0.0, 0.0)—is located at the left top
corner of the view rectangle. The x-axis extends to the right and the
y-axis extends downward; coordinate units count screen pixels. (For a
detailed discussion of the coordinate systems assumed by the Interface
Kit, see
"<a class="link" href="TheInterfaceKit_The_Coordinate_Space.html" title="The Coordinate Space">The Coordinate Space</a>")
</p><p>
When a view is added as a child of another view, it's located within the
coordinate system of its parent. A child is considered part of the
contents of the parent view. If the parent moves, the child moves with
it; if the parent view scrolls its contents, the child view is shifted
along with everything else in the view.
</p><p>
Since each view retains its own internal coordinate system no matter who
its parent is, where it's located within the parent, or where the parent
is located, a <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s
drawing and message-handling code doesn't need to
be concerned about anything exterior to itself. To do its work, a
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
need look no farther than the boundaries of its own view rectangle.
</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Frame_Bounds"></a>Frame and Bounds Rectangles</h4></div></div></div><p>
Although a <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
doesn't have to look outside its own boundaries, it does
have to know where those boundaries are. It can get this information in
two forms:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Since a view is located within the coordinate system of its parent,
the view rectangle is initially defined in terms of the parent's
coordinates. This defining rectangle for a view is known as its frame
rectangle. (See the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
constructor and the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Frame" title="Frame()"><code class="methodname">Frame()</code></a> function.)
</p></li><li><p>
When translated from the parent's coordinates to the internal
coordinates of the view itself, the same rectangle is known as the
bounds rectangle. (See the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Bounds" title="Bounds()"><code class="methodname">Bounds()</code></a> function.)
</p></li></ul><p>
The following illustration shows a child view 180.0 units wide and 135.0
units high. When viewed from the outside, from the perspective of its
parent's coordinate system, it has a frame rectangle with left, top,
right, and bottom coordinates at 90.0, 60.0, 270.0, and 195.0,
respectively. But when viewed from the inside, in the view's own
coordinate system, it has a bounds rectangle with coordinates at 0.0,
0.0, 180.0, and 135.0:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/frame_bounds.png" alt="Frame Bounds" /></div><p>
When a view moves to a new location in its parent, its frame rectangle
changes but not its bounds rectangle. When a view scrolls its contents,
its bounds rectangle changes, but not its frame. The frame rectangle
positions the view in the world outside; the bounds rectangle positions
the contents inside the view.
</p><p>
Since a <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> does
its work in its own coordinate system, it refers to
the bounds rectangle more often than to the frame rectangle.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Nonfractional_Coordinates"></a>Nonfractional Coordinates</h4></div></div></div><p>
Because views are areas within windows and windows are displayed
on-screen, the edges of a view must line up on rows and columns of screen
pixels. It's easy to achieve this result, since coordinate units
correspond to screen pixels; one unit is the distance from the center of
a pixel to the center of an adjacent pixel. Therefore, all you must do is
define the view rectangle with nonfractional coordinates, as in the
illustration above.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Pixel_Coordinate_Dimensions"></a>Pixel and Coordinate Dimensions</h4></div></div></div><p>
It was mentioned that the child view in the illustration above is 180.0
coordinate units wide and 135.0 units high. However, this view actually
covers 181 pixel columns and 136 pixel rows on-screen.
</p><p>
Two facts conspire to determine this result. First, as stated, coordinate
units correspond to screen pixels. Second, the coordinate axes don't lie
between pixels but right in the middle of them. The x-axis splits a row
of pixels and the y-axis runs down the center of a column of pixels; the
coordinate origin where they meet is at the very center of a pixel.
Therefore, a view rectangle covers one more pixel in each direction than
its coordinate dimensions would indicate.
</p><p>
Imagine an implausibly tiny frame rectangle like the one in the following
diagram:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/tiny_frame.png" alt="Tiny Frame Rectangle" /></div><p>
Since the pixels on the edges of this 2.0 * 3.0 rectangle are treated as
being inside the rectangle, the view covers a 3 pixel * 4 pixel area.
</p><p>
This fact is important when laying out views and drawing in the bounds
rectangle (or drawing any rectangle, for that matter). However, when
discussing view coordinates and rectangles in general, it's easier and
more accurate to speak in terms of coordinate values, not
pixels—and that's the practice in this chapter. However, see
"Mapping Coordinates to Pixels"
for more on how coordinate values relate to pixels.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Scrolling"></a>Scrolling</h4></div></div></div><p>
A <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> scrolls its contents by shifting coordinate values within the
view rectangle—that is, by altering the bounds rectangle. If, for
example, the top of a view's bounds rectangle is at 100.0 and its bottom
is at 200.0, scrolling downward 50.0 units would put the top at 150.0 and
the bottom at 250.0. Contents of the view with y-coordinate values of
150.0 to 200.0, originally displayed in the bottom half of the view,
would be shifted to the top half. Contents with y-coordinate values from
200.0 to 250.0, previously unseen, would become visible at the bottom of
the view, as shown in the following illustration:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/scrolling.png" alt="Scrolling The View" /></div><p>
Scrolling doesn't move the view—it doesn't alter the frame
rectangle—it moves only what's displayed inside the view. In the
illustration above, a "data rectangle" encloses everything the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> is
capable of drawing. For example, if the view is able to display an entire
book, the data rectangle would be large enough to enclose all the lines
and pages of the book laid end to end. However, since a
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> can draw
only within its bounds rectangle, everything in the data rectangle with
coordinates that fall outside the bounds rectangle would be invisible. To
make unseen data visible, the bounds rectangle must change the
coordinates that it encompasses. Scrolling can be thought of as sliding
the view's bounds rectangle to a new position on its data rectangle, as
is shown in the illustration above. However, as it appears to the user,
it's moving the data rectangle under the bounds rectangle. The view
doesn't move; the data does.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Clipping_Region"></a>The Clipping Region</h4></div></div></div><p>
The Application Server clips the images that a
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> produces to the
region where it's permitted to draw.
</p><p>
This region is never any larger than the view's bounds rectangle; a view
cannot draw outside its bounds. Furthermore, since a child is considered
part of its parent, a view can't draw outside the bounds rectangle of its
parent either—or, for that matter, outside the bounds rectangle of
any ancestor view. In addition, since child views draw after, and
therefore logically in front of, their parents, a view concedes some of
its territory to its children.
</p><p>
Thus, the visible region of a view is the part of its bounds rectangle
that's inside the bounds rectangles of all its ancestors, minus the frame
rectangles of its children. This is illustrated in the following figure.
It shows a hierarchy of three views—X, Y, and Z. The area filled
with a crosshatch pattern is the visible region of view X; it omits the
area occupied by its child, view Y. The visible region of view Y is
colored dark gray; it omits the part of the view that lies outside its
parent. View Z has no visible region, for it lies outside the bounds
rectangle of its ancestor, view X:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/drawing4.png" alt="View Clipping Outside The Parent" /></div><p>
The visible region of a view might be further restricted if its window is
obscured by another window or if the window it's in lies partially
off-screen. The visible region includes only those areas that are
actually visible to the user. For example, if the three views in the
previous illustration were in a window that was partially blocked by
another window, their visible regions might be considerably smaller. This
is shown in the next figure:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/drawing5.png" alt="Clipping Areas For Covered Windows" /></div><p>
Note that in this case, view X has a discontinuous visible region.
</p><p>
The Application Server clips the drawing that a view does to a region
that's never any larger than the visible region. On occasion, it may be
smaller. For the sake of efficiency, while a view is being automatically
updated, the clipping region excludes portions of the visible region that
don't need to be redrawn:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
When a view is scrolled, the Application Server may be able to shift
some of its contents from one portion of the visible region to another.
The clipping region excludes any part of the visible region that the
server was able to update on its own; it includes only the part where
the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> must produce images that were not previously visible.
</p></li><li><p>
If a view is resized larger, the clipping region may include only the
new areas that were added to the visible region. (But see the flags
argument for the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> constructor.)
</p></li><li><p>
If only part of a view is invalidated (by the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Invalidate" title="Invalidate()"><code class="methodname">Invalidate()</code></a> function),
the clipping region is the intersection of the visible region and the
invalid rectangle.
</p></li></ul><p>
An application can also limit the clipping region for a view by passing a
<a class="link" href="BRegion.html" title="BRegion"><code class="classname">BRegion</code></a>
object to
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_ConstrainClippingRegion" title="ConstrainClippingRegion()"><code class="methodname">ConstrainClippingRegion()</code></a>.
The clipping region won't
include any areas that aren't in the region passed. The Application
Server calculates the clipping region as it normally would but intersects
it with the specified region.
</p><p>
You can obtain the current clipping region for a view by calling
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_GetClippingRegion" title="GetClippingRegion()"><code class="methodname">GetClippingRegion()</code></a>.
(See also the <a class="link" href="BRegion.html" title="BRegion"><code class="classname">BRegion</code></a> class description.)
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_View_Color"></a>The View Color</h4></div></div></div><p>
Every view has a basic, underlying color. It's the color that fills the
view rectangle before the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> does any drawing. The Application Server
paints the view with this color before any view-specific drawing
functions are called. The user may catch a glimpse of the color when the
view is first shown on-screen, when it's resized larger, and when it's
erased in preparation for an update. It will also be seen wherever the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> fails to draw in the visible region.
</p><p>
In a sense, the view color is the canvas on which the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> draws. It
doesn't enter into any of the object's drawing operations except to
provide a background. Although it's one of the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s graphics
parameters, it's not one that any drawing functions refer to.
</p><p>
The default view color is white. You can assign a different color to a
view by calling <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetViewColor" title="SetViewColor(), ViewColor()"><code class="methodname">SetViewColor()</code></a> function. If you set the view
color to <code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_COLOR</code>, the Application Server won't erase the
view's clipping region before an update. This is appropriate only if the
view erases itself by touching every pixel in the clipping region when it
draws.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_BackgroundBitmap"></a>The Background Bitmap</h4></div></div></div><p>
Every view may additionally have a background bitmap. The Application
Server draws this bitmap after it fills in the view color and before any
view-specific drawing functions are called. The view color will be
visible in regions the background bitmap doesn't cover.
</p><p>
A view begins life without a background bitmap. A background bitmap may
be added with <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetViewBitmap" title="SetViewBitmap(), ClearViewBitmap()"><code class="methodname">SetViewBitmap()</code></a>
function and subsequently removed with
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_ClearViewBitmap"><code class="methodname">ClearViewBitmap()</code></a>.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Mechanics_Drawing"></a>The Mechanics of Drawing</h3></div></div></div><p>
Views draw through the following set of primitive functions:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DrawString" title="DrawString()"><code class="methodname">DrawString()</code></a>
draws a string of characters.
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DrawChar" title="DrawChar()"><code class="methodname">DrawChar()</code></a>
is a variant of this function; it draws just a single character.
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DrawPicture" title="DrawPicture(), DrawPictureAsync()"><code class="methodname">DrawPicture()</code></a>
executes a set of recorded drawing instructions.
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DrawBitmap" title="DrawBitmap(), DrawBitmapAsync()"><code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code></a>
produces an image from a bitmap.
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DrawBitmap" title="DrawBitmap(), DrawBitmapAsync()"><code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code></a>CopyBits()
copies an image from one location to another.
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_FillEllipse"><code class="methodname">FillEllipse()</code></a>,
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_FillRegion" title="FillRegion()"><code class="methodname">FillRegion()</code></a>,
and other <code class="methodname">Fill…()</code> functions fill closed shapes.
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_StrokeLine" title="StrokeLine()"><code class="methodname">StrokeLine()</code></a>,
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_StrokeArc"><code class="methodname">StrokeArc()</code></a>,
and other <code class="methodname">Stroke…()</code> functions stroke
lines along defined paths.
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_BeginLineArray" title="BeginLineArray(), AddLine(), EndLineArray()"><code class="methodname">BeginLineArray()</code></a>,
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AddLine"><code class="methodname">AddLine()</code></a>, and
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_EndLineArray"><code class="methodname">EndLineArray()</code></a> draw a set of
straight lines, all of the same width, but possibly in different colors.
</p></li></ul><p>
The way these functions work depends not only on the values that they're
passed—the particular string, bitmap, arc, or ellipse that's to be
drawn—but on previously set values in the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s graphics
environment.
</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Graphics_Environment"></a>Graphics Environment</h4></div></div></div><p>
Each <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
object maintains its own graphics environment for drawing. The
view color, coordinate system, and clipping region are fundamental parts
of that environment, but not the only parts. It also includes a number of
parameters that can be set and reset at will to affect the next image
drawn. These parameters are:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Font attributes that determine the appearance of text the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
draws. (See
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetFont" title="SetFont(), GetFont()"><code class="methodname">SetFont()</code></a> and the
<a class="link" href="BFont.html" title="BFont"><code class="classname">BFont</code></a> class.)
</p></li><li><p>
Two pen parameters—a location and a size. The pen location
determines where the next drawing will occur, and the pen size
determines the thickness of stroked lines. (See
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_MovePenBy" title="MovePenBy(), MovePenTo(), PenLocation()"><code class="methodname">MovePenBy()</code></a> and
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetPenSize" title="SetPenSize(), PenSize()"><code class="methodname">SetPenSize()</code></a>.)
</p></li><li><p>
Two current colors—a high color and a low color—that can
be used either alone or in combination to form a pattern or halftone.
The high color is used for most drawing. The low color is sometimes set
to the underlying view color so that it can be used to erase other
drawing or, because it matches the view background, make it appear that
drawing has not touched certain pixels.
</p><p>
(The high and low colors roughly match what other systems call the
fore and back, or foreground and background, colors. However, neither
color truly represents the color of the foreground or background. The
terminology high and low is meant to keep the sense of two opposing
colors and to match how they're defined in a pattern. A pattern bit is
turned on for the high color and turned off for the low color. See the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetHighColor" title="SetHighColor(), HighColor() , SetLowColor() , LowColor()"><code class="methodname">SetHighColor()</code></a> and
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetLowColor"><code class="methodname">SetLowColor()</code></a> functions in the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> class
description and the
"<a class="link" href="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing.html#TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Patterns" title="Patterns">Patterns</a>"
section.
</p></li><li><p>
A drawing mode that determines how the next image is to be rendered.
(See
"<a class="link" href="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing.html#TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Drawing_Modes" title="Drawing Modes">Drawing Modes</a>" and the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetDrawingMode" title="SetDrawingMode(), DrawingMode()"><code class="methodname">SetDrawingMode()</code></a>
function.)
</p></li></ul><p>
By default, a <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s
graphics parameters are set to the following values:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Font</td><td>The system plain font (be_plain_font)</td></tr><tr><td>Pen position</td><td>(0.0, 0.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Pen size</td><td>1.0 coordinate units</td></tr><tr><td>High color</td><td>Black (red, green, and blue components all equal to 0)</td></tr><tr><td>Low color</td><td>White (red, green, and blue components all equal to 255)</td></tr><tr><td>Drawing mode</td><td>Copy mode (<code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code>)</td></tr><tr><td>View color</td><td>White (red, green, and blue components all equal to 255)</td></tr><tr><td>Clipping region</td><td>The visible region of the view</td></tr><tr><td>Coordinate system</td><td>Origin at the left top corner of the bounds rectangle</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
However, as
"<a class="link" href="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing.html#TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Views_Server" title="Views and the Server">Views and the Server</a>"

The pen is a fiction that encompasses two properties of a view's graphics
environment: the current drawing location and the thickness of stroked
lines.
</p><p>
The pen location determines where the next image will be drawn—but
only if another location isn't explicitly passed to the drawing function.
Some drawing functions alter the pen location—as if the pen
actually moves as it does the drawing—but usually it's set by
calling <a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_MovePenBy" title="MovePenBy(), MovePenTo(), PenLocation()"><code class="methodname">MovePenBy()</code></a>
or
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_MovePenTo"><code class="methodname">MovePenTo()</code></a>.
</p><p>
The pen that draws lines (through the various <code class="methodname">Stroke…()</code> functions) has
a malleable tip that can be made broader or narrower by calling the
calling <a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetPenSize" title="SetPenSize(), PenSize()"><code class="methodname">SetPenSize()</code></a>
function. The larger the pen size, the thicker the line that
it draws.
</p><p>
The pen size is expressed in coordinate units, which must be translated
to a particular number of pixels for the display device. This is done by
scaling the pen size to a device-specific value and rounding to the
closest integer. For example, pen sizes of 2.6 and 3.3 would both
translate to 3 pixels on-screen, but to 7 and 10 pixels respectively on a
300dpi printer.
</p><p>
The size is never rounded to 0; no matter how small the pen may be, the
line never disappears. If the pen size is set to 0.0, the line will be as
thin as possible—it will be drawn using the fewest possible pixels
on the display device. (In other words, it will be rounded to 1 for all
devices.)
</p><p>
If the pen size translates to a tip that's broader than 1 pixel, the line
is drawn with the tip centered on the path of the line. Roughly the same
number of pixels are colored on both sides of the path.
</p><p>
A later section,
"<a class="link" href="TheInterfaceKit_The_Coordinate_Space.html#TheInterfaceKit_The_Coordinate_Space_Picking_Pixels" title="Picking Pixels to Stroke and Fill">Picking Pixels to Stroke and Fill</a>",
illustrates how pens of different sizes choose the pixels to be colored.

The high and low colors are specified as rgb_color values—full
32-bit values with separate red, green, and blue color components, plus
an alpha component for transparency. Although there may sometimes be
limitations on the colors that can be rendered on-screen, there are no
restrictions on the colors that can be specified.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Color_Spaces"></a>Color Spaces</h4></div></div></div><p>
The way colors are specified for a bitmap depends on the color space in
which they're interpreted. The color space determines the depth of the
bitmap data (how many bits of information are stored for each pixel), the
interpretation of the data (whether it represents shades of gray or true
colors, whether it's segmented into color components, what the components
are, and so on), and the arrangement of components within the data
(whether big-endian or little-endian). These six basic color spaces are
recognized:
</p><table class="variablelist"><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_GRAY1</code></span></p></td><td><p>One bit of data per pixel, where 1 is black and 0 is white.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_GRAY8</code></span></p></td><td><p>Eight bits of data per pixel, where a value of 255 is black and 0
is white.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code></span></p></td><td><p>Eight bits of data per pixel, interpreted as an index into a list
of 256 colors. The list is part of the system color map and is the same
for all applications.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_RGB15</code></span></p></td><td><p>Three components of data per pixel—blue, green, and red, in
that order—with 5 bits each for red, green, and blue. The first bit
of the pixel data is not associated with any color component.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_RGBA15</code></span></p></td><td><p>Four components of data per pixel—blue, green, red, and
alpha, in that order—with 5 bits each for red, green, and blue, and
1 bit for alpha.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_RGB16</code></span></p></td><td><p>Three components of data per pixel—blue, green, and red, in
that order—with 5 bits each for red and blue, and 6 bits for green.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_RGB32</code></span></p></td><td><p>Four components of data per pixel—blue, green, red, and
alpha, in that order—with 8 bits per component. A component value
of 255 yields the maximum amount of red, green, or blue, and a value of 0
indicates the absence of that color.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
The components in the <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code>, <code class="constant">B_RGB16</code>,
and <code class="constant">B_RGB15</code> color spaces are
meshed rather than separated into distinct planes; all four components
are specified for the first pixel before the four components for the
second pixel, and so on. The order of bytes for these two types is
little-endian, which means that for <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code> data, the component bytes
appear in the order blue, green, red, and alpha.
</p><p>
Counterpart color spaces are defined for big-endian data. <code class="constant">B_RGB32_BIG</code>,
<code class="constant">B_RGBA16_BIG</code>, <code class="constant">B_RGBA15_BIG</code>, and
<code class="constant">B_RGB15</code>_BIG, are equivalent to <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code>,
<code class="constant">B_RGB16</code>, <code class="constant">B_RGBA15</code>,
and <code class="constant">B_RGB15</code>—except for the order of bytes. The
Be operating system retains data in the little-endian formats; the
big-endian color spaces are defined only to label noncompatible data that
the system must convert and to allow drivers to communicate precise
formats to the operating system.
</p><p>
Alpha should be 0 for 100% transparent, or 255 (for 8-bit alpha channels)
for 100% opaque. For 1-bit alpha channels, a value of 1 indicates opaque.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_The_Screen"></a>The Screen</h4></div></div></div><p>
The screen can be configured to display colors in either the <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code>,
<code class="constant">B_RGB15</code>, or <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code> color spaces.
When it's in the <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code> or <code class="constant">B_RGB15</code>
color spaces, specified <span class="type">rgb_color</span>s are displayed as the closest available
color. (See the
<a class="link" href="BBitmap.html" title="BBitmap"><code class="classname">BBitmap</code></a> and
<a class="link" href="BScreen.html" title="BScreen"><code class="classname">BScreen</code></a> classes.)
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Patterns"></a>Patterns</h4></div></div></div><p>
Most functions that stroke a line or fill a closed shape don't draw
directly in either the high or the low color. Rather they take a pattern,
an arrangement of one or both colors that's repeated over the entire
surface being drawn. A pattern might consist of just the high color, just
the low color, or some combination of the two.
</p><p>
By combining the low color with the high color, patterns can produce
dithered colors that lie somewhere between two hues in the <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code> color
space. Patterns also permit drawing with less than the solid high color
(for intermittent or broken lines, for example) and can take advantage of
drawing modes that treat the low color as if it were transparent, as
discussed in the next section.
</p><p>
A pattern is defined as an 8-pixel by 8-pixel square. The <span class="type">pattern</span> type is
8 bytes long, with 1 byte per row and 1 bit per pixel. Rows are specified
from top to bottom and pixels from left to right. Bits marked 1 designate
the high color; those marked 0 designate the low color. For example, a
pattern of wide diagonal stripes could be defined as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting example cpp"><span class="type">pattern</span> <code class="varname">stripes</code> = { 0xc7, 0x8f, 0x1f, 0x3e,
                  0x7c, 0xf8, 0xf1, 0xe3 };</pre><p>
Patterns repeat themselves across the screen, like tiles laid side by
side. The pattern defined above looks like this:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/fill_pattern.png" alt="Fill Patterns" /></div><p>
The dotted lines in this illustration show the separation of the screen
into pixels. The thicker black line outlines one 8 * 8 square that the
pattern defines.
</p><p>
The outline of the shape being filled or the width of the line being
stroked determines where the pattern is revealed. It's as if the screen
was covered with the pattern just below the surface, and stroking or
filling allowed some of it to show through. For example, stroking a
1-pixel wide horizontal path in the pattern illustrated above would
result in a dotted line, with the dashes (in the high color) slightly
longer than the spaces between (in the low color):
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/line_pattern.png" alt="Line Patterns" /></div><p>
When stroking a line or filling a shape, the pattern serves as the source
image for the current drawing mode, as explained in
"<a class="link" href="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing.html#TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Drawing_Modes" title="Drawing Modes">Drawing Modes</a>"
next. The nature of the mode determines how the pattern interacts with the
destination image, the image already in place.
</p><p>
The Interface Kit defines three patterns:
</p><table class="variablelist"><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_SOLID_HIGH</code></span></p></td><td><p>Consists only of the high color.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_SOLID_LOW</code></span></p></td><td><p>Has only the low color.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_MIXED_COLORS</code></span></p></td><td><p>Mixes the two colors evenly, like the pattern on a
checkerboard.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
<code class="constant">B_SOLID_HIGH</code> is the default pattern for all drawing functions.
Applications can define as many other patterns as they need.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Drawing_Modes"></a>Drawing Modes</h4></div></div></div><p>
When a <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> draws, it in effect transfers an image to a target location
somewhere in the view rectangle. The drawing mode determines how the
image being transferred interacts with the image already in place at that
location. The image being transferred is known as the source image; it
might be a bitmap or a pattern of some kind. The image already in place
is known as the destination image.
</p><p>
In the simplest and most straightforward kind of drawing, the source
image is simply painted over the destination; the source replaces the
destination. However, there are other possibilities. There are ten
different drawing modes—ten distinct ways of combining the source
and destination images. The modes are designated by <span class="type">drawing_mode</span>
constants that can be passed to
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetDrawingMode" title="SetDrawingMode(), DrawingMode()"><code class="methodname">SetDrawingMode()</code></a>:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code></td><td><code class="constant">B_OP_ADD</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code></td><td><code class="constant">B_OP_SUBTRACT</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="constant">B_OP_ERASE</code></td><td><code class="constant">B_OP_BLEND</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="constant">B_OP_INVERT</code></td><td><code class="constant">B_OP_MIN</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="constant">B_OP_SELECT</code></td><td><code class="constant">B_OP_MAX</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
<code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code> is the default mode and the simplest. It transfers the source
image to the destination, replacing whatever was there before. The
destination is ignored.
</p><p>
In the other modes, however, some of the destination might be preserved,
or the source and destination might be combined to form a result that's
different from either of them. For these modes, it's convenient to think
of the source image as an image that exists somewhere independent of the
destination location, even though it's not actually visible. It's the
image that would be rendered at the destination in <code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code> mode.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Bitmaps_Patterns"></a>Bitmaps and Patterns</h4></div></div></div><p>
The modes work for all <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> drawing functions—including those that
stroke lines and fill shapes, those that draw characters, and those that
image bitmaps. The way they work depends foremost on the nature of the
source image—whether it's a pattern or a bitmap. For the <code class="methodname">Fill…()</code>
and <code class="methodname">Stroke…()</code> functions, the source image is a pattern that has the
same shape as the area being filled or the area the pen touches as it
strokes a line. For
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DrawBitmap" title="DrawBitmap(), DrawBitmapAsync()"><code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code></a>,
the source image is a rectangular bitmap.
</p><p>
In a sense, a pattern is simply a bitmap that's one bit deep. It's a
bitmap consisting of two colors, one which maps to the current high color
and another that maps to the current low color. As we shall see later, a
<code class="constant">B_MONOCHROME_1_BIT</code> bitmap acts just like a pattern. However, patterns and
bitmaps generally behave differently:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Only a source pattern has designated high and low colors. Even if a
source bitmap has colors that match the current high and low colors,
they're not handled like the colors in a pattern; they're treated just
like any other color in the bitmap.
</p></li><li><p>
On the other hand, only a source bitmap can have transparent pixels.
In the <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code> color space, a pixel is made transparent by assigning it
the <code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_MAGIC_CMAP8</code> value. In the <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code> color space, a
pixel assigned the <code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_MAGIC_RGBA32</code> value is considered
transparent. These values have meaning only for source bitmaps, not for
source patterns. If the current high or low color in a pattern happens
to have a transparent value, it's still treated as the high or low
color, not like transparency in a bitmap. For big endian color spaces,
the transparency color should be byte-swapped from its little endian
counterpart.
</p></li></ul><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_MAGIC_CMAP8</code></td><td>8-bit indexed color transparent pixel.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_MAGIC_RGBA15</code></td><td>15-bit transparent pixel.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_MAGIC_RGBA15_BIG</code></td><td>15-bit transparent pixel, big-endian.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_MAGIC_RGBA32</code></td><td>32-bit transparent pixel.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_MAGIC_RGBA32_BIG</code></td><td>32-bit transparent pixel, big-endian.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Drawing_Modes_Color_Spaces"></a>Drawing Modes and Color Spaces</h4></div></div></div><p>
The way the drawing modes work also depends on the color space of the
source image and the color space of the destination. The following
discussion concentrates on drawing where the source and destination both
contain colors. This is the most common case, and also the one that's
most general.
</p><p>
The source and destination images can have different color spaces. For
example, a source bitmap might be defined in the <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code> space while the
destination is displayed in the full color <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code> color space. The
drawing operation merely combines the colors in the two images in some
way. It doesn't transfer the color space of the source image to the
destination. The image that results from the drawing operation will
always be in the color space of the destination image.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Mode_Definitions"></a>Mode Definitions</h4></div></div></div><p>
When applied to colors, the ten drawing modes fall naturally into four
groups:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The <code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code> mode, which copies the source image to the destination.
</p></li><li><p>
The <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code>, <code class="constant">B_OP_ERASE</code>,
<code class="constant">B_OP_INVERT</code>, and <code class="constant">B_OP_SELECT</code> modes,
which—despite their differences—all treat the low color in
a pattern as if it were transparent.
</p></li><li><p>
The <code class="constant">B_OP_ADD</code>, <code class="constant">B_OP_SUBTRACT</code>, and
<code class="constant">B_OP_BLEND</code> modes, which combine
colors in the source and destination images.
</p></li><li><p>
The <code class="constant">B_OP_MIN</code> and <code class="constant">B_OP_MAX</code> modes,
which choose between the source and destination colors.
</p></li></ul><p>
The following paragraphs describe each of these groups in turn.
</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Mode_Definitions_Copy"></a>Copy Mode</h5></div></div></div><p>
In <code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code> mode, the source image replaces the destination. This is the
default drawing mode and the one most commonly used. Because this mode
doesn't have to test for particular color values in the source image,
look at the colors in the destination, or compute colors in the result,
it's also the fastest of the modes.
</p><p>
If the source image contains transparent pixels, their transparency will
be retained in the result; the transparent value is copied just like any
other color. However, the appearance of a transparent pixel when shown
on-screen is indeterminate. If a source image has transparent portions,
it's best to transfer it to the screen in <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code> or another mode. In
all modes other than <code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code>, a transparent pixel in a source bitmap
preserves the color of the corresponding destination pixel.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Mode_Definitions_Transparency"></a>Transparency Modes</h5></div></div></div><p>
Four drawing modes—<code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code>,
<code class="constant">B_OP_ERASE</code>, <code class="constant">B_OP_INVERT</code>, and
<code class="constant">B_OP_SELECT</code>—are designed specifically to make use of transparency
in the source image; they're able to preserve some of the destination
image. In these modes (and only these modes) the low color in a source
pattern acts just like transparency in a source bitmap.
</p><p>
Each of these modes has a different effect on the destination
image—but only in those places where the source image is not
transparent. One of the modes, <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code>, transfers some of the source
image to the destination. The other three modes play with the destination
in some way—erase it, invert it, or select colors in
it—without regard to the source image. For these modes, the only
thing that matters about the source image is where it's transparent and
where it's not. Each of the four modes is described below:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code> mode places the source image "over" the destination;
the source provides the foreground and the destination the background.
In this mode, the source image replaces the destination image (just as
in the <code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code> mode)—except where a source bitmap has
transparent pixels and a source pattern has the low color. Transparency
in a bitmap and the low color in a pattern retain the destination image
in the result.
</p></li><li><p>
By masking out the unwanted parts of a rectangular bitmap with
transparent pixels, this mode can place an irregularly shaped source
image in front of a background image. Transparency in the source
foreground lets the destination background show through. The
versatility of <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code> makes it the second most commonly used mode,
after <code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
The <code class="constant">B_OP_ERASE</code> mode doesn't draw the source image at all. Instead, it
erases the destination image. Like <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code>, it preserves the
destination image wherever a source bitmap is transparent or a source
pattern has the low color. But everywhere else—where the source
bitmap isn't transparent and the source pattern has the high
color—it removes the destination image, replacing it with the low
color.
</p><p>
Although this mode can be used for selective erasing, it's simpler to
erase by filling an area with the B_SOLID_LOW pattern in <code class="constant">B_OP_COPY</code> mode.
</p></li><li><p>
The <code class="constant">B_OP_INVERT</code> mode, like <code class="constant">B_OP_ERASE</code>, doesn't draw the source image.
Instead, it inverts the colors in the destination image. As in the case
of the <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code> and <code class="constant">B_OP_ERASE</code> modes, where a source bitmap is
transparent or a source pattern has the low color, the destination
image remains unchanged in the result. Everywhere else, the color of
the destination image is inverted.
</p><p>
The inversion of an rgb_color is the complement of its color
components. For example, the inversion of a red value of 58 would be
197 (255 - 58).
</p></li><li><p>
The <code class="constant">B_OP_SELECT</code> mode also doesn't draw the source image. It replaces
the high color in the destination image with the low color and the low
color with the high color. As for the other modes in this group, where
a source bitmap is transparent or a source pattern has the low color,
the destination image remains unchanged in the result. Everywhere else,
the high and low colors are switched.
</p><p>
This is similar to the <code class="constant">B_OP_INVERT</code> mode, except that <code class="constant">B_OP_SELECT</code>
affects at most only two colors in the destination image. The
destination is preserved not only where the source is transparent, but
also where its colors don't match the current high and low colors.
</p></li></ul><p>
These four modes also work for monochrome images. If the source image is
monochrome, the distinction between source bitmaps and source patterns
breaks down. Two rules apply:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
If the source image is a monochrome bitmap, it acts just like a
pattern. A value of 1 in the bitmap designates the current high color,
and a value of 0 designates the current low color. Thus, 0, rather than
<code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_MAGIC_*</code>, becomes the transparent value.
</p></li><li><p>
If the source and destination are both monochrome, the high color is
necessarily black (1), and the low color is necessarily white
(0)—but otherwise the drawing modes work as described. With the
possible colors this severely restricted, the three modes are reduced
to boolean operations: <code class="constant">B_OP_OVER</code> is the same as a logical OR,
<code class="constant">B_OP_INVERT</code> and <code class="constant">B_OP_SELECT</code>
are the same as logical exclusive OR, and
<code class="constant">B_OP_ERASE</code> is the same as an inversion of logical AND.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Mode_Definitions_Blending"></a>Blending Modes</h5></div></div></div><p>
Three drawing modes—<code class="constant">B_OP_ADD</code>, <code class="constant">B_OP_SUBTRACT</code>, and
<code class="constant">B_OP_BLEND</code>—combine the source and destination images, pixel by
pixel, and color component by color component. As in most of the other
modes, transparency in a source bitmap preserves the destination image in
the result. Elsewhere, the result is a combination of the source and
destination. The high and low colors of a source pattern aren't treated
in any special way; they're handled just like other colors.
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_OP_ADD</code> adds each component of the source color to the corresponding
component of the destination color, with a component value of 255 as
the limit. Colors become brighter, closer to white.
</p><p>
By adding a uniform gray to each pixel in the destination, for
example, the whole destination image can be brightened by a constant
amount.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_OP_SUBTRACT</code> subtracts each component of the source color from the
corresponding component of the destination color, with a component
value of 0 as the limit. Colors become darker, closer to black.
</p><p>
For example, by subtracting a uniform amount from the red component
of each pixel in the destination, the whole image can be made less red.
</p></li><li><p>
<code class="constant">B_OP_BLEND</code> averages each component of the source and destination
colors (adds the source and destination components and divides by 2).
The two images are merged into one.
</p></li></ul><p>
These modes work only for color images, not for monochrome ones. If the
source or destination is specified in the <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code> color space, the color
will be expanded to a full <code class="constant">B_RGB32</code> value to compute the result; the
result is then contracted to the closest color in the <code class="constant">B_CMAP8</code> color space.

Two drawing modes—<code class="constant">B_OP_MAX</code> and <code class="constant">B_OP_MIN</code>—compare each pixel in
the source image to the corresponding pixel in the destination image and
select one to keep in the result. If the source pixel is transparent,
both modes select the destination pixel. Otherwise, <code class="constant">B_OP_MIN</code> selects the
darker of the two colors and <code class="constant">B_OP_MAX</code> selects the brighter of the two. If
the source image is a uniform shade of gray, for example, <code class="constant">B_OP_MAX</code> would
substitute that shade for every pixel in the destination image that was
darker than the gray.
</p><p>
Like the blending modes, <code class="constant">B_OP_MIN</code> and <code class="constant">B_OP_MAX</code> work only for color images.

Windows lead a dual life—as on-screen entities provided by the
Application Server and as
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a> objects in the application.
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>s have
a similar dual existence—each
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> object has a shadow counterpart
in the server. The server knows the view's location, its place in the
window's hierarchy, its visible area, and the current state of its
graphics parameters. Because it has this information, the server can more
efficiently associate a user action with a particular view and interpret
the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s drawing instructions.
</p><p>
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a>s become known to the
Application Server when they're constructed; creating a
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a> object causes the server
to produce the window that the user will eventually see on-screen. A
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>, on the other hand, has
no effect on the server when it's constructed. It becomes known to the
server only when it's attached to a
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a>. The server must look through
the application's windows to see what views it has.
</p><p>
A <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> that's not attached to
a window therefore lacks a counterpart in
the server. This restricts what some functions can do. Three groups of
functions are affected:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
Drawing functions—<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DrawBitmap" title="DrawBitmap(), DrawBitmapAsync()"><code class="methodname">DrawBitmap()</code></a>,
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_FillRect"><code class="methodname">FillRect()</code></a>,
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_StrokeLine" title="StrokeLine()"><code class="methodname">StrokeLine()</code></a>, and
so on—don't work for unattached views. A <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> can't draw unless
it's in a window.
</p></li><li><p>
The scrolling functions—<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_ScrollTo"><code class="methodname">ScrollTo()</code></a>
and <a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_ScrollBy" title="ScrollBy(), ScrollTo()"><code class="methodname">ScrollBy()</code></a>—require
the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> to be in a window. Manipulations of a view's coordinate
system are carried out in its server counterpart.
</p></li><li><p>
Functions that indirectly depend on a <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s graphics
parameters—such as
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_GetMouse" title="GetMouse()"><code class="methodname">GetMouse()</code></a>, which reports the cursor location
in the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s coordinates—also require the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> to belong to a
window. These functions need information that an unattached <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> can't
provide.
</p></li></ul><p>
However, the functions that set and return graphics parameters—such as
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetFont" title="SetFont(), GetFont()"><code class="methodname">SetFont()</code></a>,
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetDrawingMode" title="SetDrawingMode(), DrawingMode()"><code class="methodname">SetDrawingMode()</code></a>,
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_PenLocation"><code class="methodname">PenLocation()</code></a>, and
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetHighColor" title="SetHighColor(), HighColor() , SetLowColor() , LowColor()"><code class="methodname">SetHighColor()</code></a>—are
not restricted. A view's graphic state is kept
within the server (where it's needed to carry out drawing instructions),
but also cached by the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>. Therefore, it's possible to assign a value
to a graphics parameter before the server knows about the view. The value
is simply cached until the view becomes part of a window's view
hierarchy; the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> then hands it to the server. The server and the
client-side cache are always kept in synch.
</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Attaching_Window"></a>Attaching to a Window</h4></div></div></div><p>
Although you can set a <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s
graphics parameters before it belongs to a
window and has a counterpart in the Application Server, some of its
initialization may need to wait until the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> receives an
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AttachedToWindow" title="AttachedToWindow(), AllAttached()"><code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code></a>
notification informing it that it has been added to a
window's view hierarchy. For example, if a view adopts the background
color of its parent, it can only set the view color in
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AttachedToWindow" title="AttachedToWindow(), AllAttached()"><code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code></a>:
</p><pre class="programlisting example cpp"><span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">MyView</code>::<code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow</code>(<span class="type">void</span>)
{
   if ( <code class="methodname">Parent</code>() )
      <code class="methodname">SetViewColor</code>(<code class="methodname">Parent</code>()-&gt;<code class="methodname">ViewColor</code>());
   . . .
}</pre><p>
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AttachedToWindow" title="AttachedToWindow(), AllAttached()"><code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code></a>
is called for each view that's added to a window,
beginning with the root view being attached, followed by each of its
children, and so on down the hierarchy. After all views have been
notified with an
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AttachedToWindow" title="AttachedToWindow(), AllAttached()"><code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code></a>
function call, they each get an
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AllAttached"><code class="methodname">AllAttached()</code></a>
notification, but in the reverse order. A parent view that
must adjust itself to calculations made by a child view when it's
attached to a window can wait until
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AllAttached"><code class="methodname">AllAttached()</code></a> to do the work.
</p><p>
These two function calls are matched by another
pair—<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DetachedFromWindow" title="DetachedFromWindow(), AllDetached()"><code class="methodname">DetachedFromWindow()</code></a> and
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AllDetached"><code class="methodname">AllDetached()</code></a>—which notify
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>s that they're about to be removed from the window.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Preparing_To_Draw"></a>Preparing to Draw</h4></div></div></div><p>
A <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
doesn't have to draw anything within its frame rectangle—it
can just be a container for other
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>s that do draw there. However,
most views that you implement will draw. And most views draw by
implementing the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a>
function. This function is called upon to present
the view on-screen (or, when printing, on a page). It's implemented using
the primitive drawing functions listed above. If your
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> includes a
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a>
implementation, you must include <code class="constant">B_WILL_DRAW</code> in the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s flags
upon construction.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_The_Update_Mechanism"></a>The Update Mechanism</h4></div></div></div><p>
The Application Server sends a message to a
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a> whenever any of the
views within the window need to be updated. The
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a> then calls the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a>
function of each out-of-date
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
so that it can redraw the contents of its on-screen display.
</p><p>
Update messages can arrive at any time. A
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a> receives one when the
window is first placed on screen, or is shown after being hidden
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The window is first placed on-screen, or is shown again after having
been hidden.
</p></li><li><p>
Any part of the window becomes visible after being obscured.
</p></li><li><p>
The views in the window are rearranged—for example, if a view
is resized or a child is removed from the hierarchy.
</p></li><li><p>
Something happens to alter what a particular view displays. For
example, if the contents of a view are scrolled, the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> must draw
any new images that scrolling makes visible. If one of its children
moves, it must fill in the area the child view vacated.
</p></li><li><p>
The application forces an update by "invalidating" a view, or a
portion of a view.
</p></li></ul><p>
As update messages arrive, they jump to the head of the
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a>'s message
queue.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Forcing_An_Update"></a>Forcing an Update</h4></div></div></div><p>
When a user action or a
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
function alters a view—if the view is scrolled, for example—an update
message is sent and the <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a>
function is automatically called. But if the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a> function
depends on some other state that's defined by your application, you need
to tell the Application Server that your
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
needs an update message. You do this by invoking
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Invalidate" title="Invalidate()"><code class="methodname">Invalidate()</code></a> function.
</p><p>
For example, let's say your <code class="classname">D2DView</code> subclass connects some dots by
reading points out of a
<a class="link" href="BList.html" title="BList"><code class="classname">BList</code></a> and drawing lines between them:
</p><pre class="programlisting example cpp"><span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">D2DView</code>::<code class="methodname">Draw</code>(<code class="classname">BRect</code> <code class="parameter">update</code>)
{
   <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="varname">i</code> = 1;
   if (<code class="varname">dotList</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">CountItems</code>() &gt; 1) {
      <code class="methodname">MovePenTo</code>(*(<span class="type">BPoint *</span>)<code class="varname">dotList</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ItemAt</code>(0);
      while (<code class="varname">i</code> &lt; <code class="varname">dotList</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">CountItems</code>())
         <code class="methodname">StrokeLine</code>(*(<span class="type">BPoint *</span>)<code class="varname">dotList</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">ItemAt</code>(<code class="varname">i</code>++));
   }
}</pre><p>
Each "dot specification" is added through <code class="classname">DotView</code>'s
<code class="methodname">AddDot()</code> function.
<code class="methodname">AddDot()</code> includes a call to
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Invalidate" title="Invalidate()"><code class="methodname">Invalidate()</code></a>
in order to force the view to be redrawn:
</p><pre class="programlisting example cpp"><span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">D2DView</code>::<code class="methodname">AddDot</code>(<code class="classname">BPoint</code> <code class="parameter">p</code>)
{
   <code class="varname">dotList</code>-&gt;<code class="methodname">AddItem</code>(new <code class="classname">BPoint</code>(<code class="parameter">p</code>));
   <code class="methodname">Invalidate</code>();
}</pre><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Forcing_An_Update_Whilst_Responding"></a>Forcing an Update while Responding to an Event</h5></div></div></div><p>
The hook functions that respond to user
events—<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_KeyDown" title="KeyDown()"><code class="methodname">KeyDown()</code></a>,
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_MouseDown" title="MouseDown()"><code class="methodname">MouseDown()</code></a>,
and so on—are executed in the same thread that
receives window update messages. If you do something in your
implementation of one of these hook functions that causes an update, the
update message won't be processed until your hook function exits. If your
hook function does a lot of processing, your interface can become
unresponsive.
</p><p>
To get around this problem, call
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a>'s
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html#BWindow_UpdateIfNeeded" title="UpdateIfNeeded()"><code class="methodname">UpdateIfNeeded()</code></a>
function from within your hook functions' implementations.
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html#BWindow_UpdateIfNeeded" title="UpdateIfNeeded()"><code class="methodname">UpdateIfNeeded()</code></a>
forces any pending update messages to be processed immediately. The function doesn't
return until the "dirty" views are all done re-drawing. (Note that
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html#BWindow_UpdateIfNeeded" title="UpdateIfNeeded()"><code class="methodname">UpdateIfNeeded()</code></a>
only works from within the
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html" title="BWindow"><code class="classname">BWindow</code></a>'s
message loop thread.)
</p><p>
For example, let's say you want to add a random dot (within a 100x100
square) everytime the user hits a key:
</p><pre class="programlisting example cpp"><span class="type">void</span> <code class="classname">D2DView</code>::<code class="methodname">KeyDown</code>(<span class="type">const char *</span><code class="parameter">bytes</code>, <span class="type">int32</span> <code class="parameter">numBytes</code>)
{
   <code class="methodname">AddDot</code>(<code class="classname">BPoint</code>(<code class="function">rand</code>()%100, <code class="function">rand</code>()%100);
   <code class="methodname">Window</code>()-&gt;<code class="methodname">UpdateIfNeeded</code>();
   ...
}</pre><p>
Since <code class="methodname">AddDot()</code> calls
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Invalidate" title="Invalidate()"><code class="methodname">Invalidate()</code></a>,
we know that there's an update message
pending. However, the update won't normally be processed until
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_KeyDown" title="KeyDown()"><code class="methodname">KeyDown()</code></a>
exits, so we call
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html#BWindow_UpdateIfNeeded" title="UpdateIfNeeded()"><code class="methodname">UpdateIfNeeded()</code></a>,
which sees the update and calls <code class="classname">D2DView</code>'s
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a> function. When
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a> is finished,
<a class="link" href="BWindow.html#BWindow_UpdateIfNeeded" title="UpdateIfNeeded()"><code class="methodname">UpdateIfNeeded()</code></a>
returns and
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_KeyDown" title="KeyDown()"><code class="methodname">KeyDown()</code></a> continues.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Erasing_The_Clipping_Region"></a>Erasing the Clipping Region</h4></div></div></div><p>
Just before sending an update message, the Application Server prepares
the clipping region of each
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
that is about to draw by erasing it to
the view background color. Note that only the clipping region is erased,
not the entire view, and perhaps not the entire area where the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
will, in fact, draw.
</p><p>
The server forgoes this step only if the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>'s background color is set
to <code class="constant">B_TRANSPARENT_COLOR</code>.
See "<a class="link" href="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing.html#TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_View_Color" title="The View Color">The View Color</a>"
above.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Drawing_During_An_Update"></a>Drawing during an Update</h4></div></div></div><p>
While drawing, a <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
may set and reset its graphics parameters any
number of times—for example, the pen position and high color might
be repeatedly reset so that whatever is drawn next is in the right place
and has the right color. These settings are temporary. When the update is
over, all graphics parameters are reset to their initial values.
</p><p>
If, for example, <a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a>
sets the high color to a shade of light blue, as shown below,
</p><pre class="programlisting example cpp"><code class="methodname">SetHighColor</code>(152, 203, 255);</pre><p>
it doesn't mean that the high color will be blue when
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a> is called
next. If this line of code is executed during an update, light blue would
remain the high color only until the update ends or
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetHighColor" title="SetHighColor(), HighColor() , SetLowColor() , LowColor()"><code class="methodname">SetHighColor()</code></a> is
called again, whichever comes first. When the update ends, the previous
graphics state, including the previous high color, is restored.
</p><p>
Although you can change most graphics parameters during an
update—move the pen around, reset the font, change the high color,
and so on—the coordinate system can't be touched; a view can't be
scrolled while it's being updated. If the view's coordinate system were
to change, it would alter the current clipping region and confuse the
update mechanism.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_Drawing_Drawing_Outside_Of_An_Update"></a>Drawing outside of an Update</h4></div></div></div><p>
Graphics parameters that are set outside the context of an update are not
limited; they remain in effect until they're explicitly changed. For
example, if application code calls
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a>, perhaps in response to an
interface message, the parameter values that
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a> last sets would
persist even after the function returns. They would become the default
values for the view and would be assumed the next time
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a> is called.
</p><p>
Default graphics parameters are typically set as part of initializing the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> once it's attached to a window—in an
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AttachedToWindow" title="AttachedToWindow(), AllAttached()"><code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code></a>
function. If you want a
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_Draw" title="Draw()"><code class="methodname">Draw()</code></a>
function to assume the values set by
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_AttachedToWindow" title="AttachedToWindow(), AllAttached()"><code class="methodname">AttachedToWindow()</code></a>,
it's important to restore those values after any drawing the
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
does that's not the result of an update. For example, if a
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a> invokes
