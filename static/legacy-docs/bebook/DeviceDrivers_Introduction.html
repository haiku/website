workings of the BeOS. To write a driver you must follow the rules laid
out in this chapter very carefully. These rules are not the same as those
for writing a normal application—if your driver tries to do things
it's not allowed to do, it could bring down the system.</p><p>This introduction covers how drivers interact with the kernel.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id685216"></a>The Kernel and the Driver Author</h3></div></div></div><p>The BeOS kernel comprises the basic functionality of the operating
system: It knows how to start the boot process and to manage memory and
threads, and it contains the PCI bus manager, the ISA bus manager, the
device file system (devfs, which manages
<code class="filename">/dev</code>), the root file system
(rootfs, which manages <code class="filename">/</code>), and a
few other things.</p><p>But this isn't enough to satisfy the needs of most applications, so the
kernel uses add-ons to provide additional functionality. During the boot
process, add-ons are loaded to handle "real" file systems, devices,
busses, and the like.</p><p>Although Be's kernel add-ons provide support for a wide range of
hardware—from disk devices to joysticks—this support isn't
all-inclusive. Hardware developers may need to create their own drivers
for their products.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_TypesOfKernelAddOn"></a>Types of Kernel Add-on</h4></div></div></div><p>There are three types of kernel add-on:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>Device drivers are add-ons that communicate directly with devices.</p></li><li><p>Modules are kernel space add-ons that export an API for use by
drivers (or by other modules).</p></li><li><p>File systems are add-ons that support specific file systems, such as
BFS, DOSFS, HFS, and so forth.</p></li></ol></div><p>Device drivers and file systems, while extending the functionality of the
kernel, are still accessible from user space: Applications can open and
address them using file descriptors. Modules, on the other hand, are
kernel-only units. Applications have no access to them; they're provided
strictly for use by the kernel and other kernel add-ons.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_DeviceDrivers"></a>Device Drivers</h5></div></div></div><p>A device driver is an add-on that recognizes a specific device (or class
of devices) and provides a means for the rest of the system to
communicate with it. Usually this communication involves some form of
device-specific protocol. For example, if the system wants to use an
Ethernet card or graphics card, it needs to load a device driver add-on
that knows how to communicate with that card. Similarly, code that knows
how to talk to a class of devices
(<acronym class="acronym" title="Small Computer Systems Interface">SCSI</acronym>
disks, <acronym class="acronym" title="AT Attachment">ATA</acronym> devices,
<acronym class="acronym" title="AT Attachment Packet Interface">ATAPI</acronym> disks,
or <acronym class="acronym" title="Universal Serial bus">USB</acronym>
input devices, etc.) must be implemented as a device driver add-on.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_Modules"></a>Modules</h5></div></div></div><p>Modules provide a uniform <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> for use by other modules and drivers. A
module is like a library in that it acts as a repository for common code
that's shared among several drivers.</p><p>For example: Let's say you have a device driver that talks to a
<acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> device connected to a <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> bus.
A computer can have multiple <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> busses. Because all
<acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> devices use the same command set independent of the
particular controller used to send the commands, the command set can be
(and is) implemented as a module. The <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> module knows
how to handle all <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> cards the BeOS supports; the API
that the <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> module defines is adopted by and augmented
by the modules for specific <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> device types (hard
disks, scanners, CD drives, etc). The <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> device
modules are managed by a <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym> bus manager module, which
knows how to cope with multiple busses and presents them in encapulated
form to the drivers. The drivers then only need to deal with the bus
manager's API, which makes the life of a driver author much simpler.</p><p>Be provides bus managers for <acronym class="acronym">SCSI</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Integrated Drive Electronics">IDE</acronym>, and
<acronym class="acronym">PCMCIA</acronym>.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_FileSystems"></a>File Systems</h5></div></div></div><p>File system add-ons provide support for disk and network file systems,
such as <acronym class="acronym">BFS</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Hierarchical Filing System">HFS</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="File Allocation Table">FAT</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="International Standards Organization">ISO</acronym> 9660,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Common Internet Filing System">CIFS</acronym>,
and so forth. By creating new file system add-ons, developers can provide
access to disks that are formatted using other file system.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_InteractionsWithTheKernel"></a>Interactions with the Kernel</h4></div></div></div><p>The kernel provides a number of services that drivers and modules can
use. These include:</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>Enabling and disabling interrupts.</p></li><li><p>Setting up memory for
<acronym class="acronym" title="Direct Memory Access">DMA</acronym>
transactions.</p></li><li><p>Access to other devices and modules.</p></li></ul><p>The kernel also provides, at the user level, a Posix-like API for
accessing devices. An application can open a device through
<code class="function">open()</code>, and use <code class="function">read()</code>,
<code class="function">write()</code>, and <code class="function">ioctl()</code> to access
the device.</p><p>The Posix functions are converted into system calls into the kernel,
which then passes them, via devfs, to the appropriate device driver.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_devfs"></a>devfs</h3></div></div></div><p>The kernel manages device drivers through devfs, the device file
system that's mounted at
<code class="filename">/dev</code>
during the boot process. In order to be accessed,
a driver must "publish" itself by adding an entry in the
<code class="filename">/dev</code>
hierarchy. The basic Posix I/O functions (<code class="function">open()</code>,
<code class="function">read()</code>, <code class="function">write()</code>,
<code class="function">readv()</code>, <code class="function">writev()</code>,
<code class="function">ioctl()</code>, and <code class="function">close()</code>) can then be
used.</p><p>Devfs makes the drivers available as needed in
<code class="filename">/dev</code>; this usually happens
the first time a program iterates through the directory entries for a
subdirectory in <code class="filename">/dev</code>.
The kernel knows where in the /dev hierarchy to
publish drivers based on their location in
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev</code>.
For example, the <acronym class="acronym">ATAPI</acronym> driver publishes drivers in
<code class="filename">/dev/disk/ide/atapi</code>, the driver is located in
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/disk/ide/atapi</code>.
Whew.</p><p>You can see this device hierarchy by using the "ls" command from a
Terminal window. <code class="command">ls /dev</code> will show you the root of the device
hierarchy, <code class="command">ls /dev/disk</code> will show you disk device busses,
<code class="command">ls /dev/disk/ide</code> will show you the IDE devices, and so forth.</p><p>In reality, drivers tend to publish themselves in multiple locations in
the <code class="filename">/dev</code> hierarchy, so instead
of putting duplicate copies of the driver in the
<code class="filename">…/drivers/dev</code>
tree, the driver binaries are put at
<code class="filename">/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin</code>,
and symlinks are created in the
<code class="filename">…/drivers/dev</code>
tree at the appropriate place. (The same is also done for drivers in
<code class="filename">/boot/home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/…</code>)</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_DriverImplementationPrinciples"></a>Driver Implementation Principles</h3></div></div></div><p>Much of the stability of the BeOS is achieved by constructing a nearly
impenetrable wall between the kernel and user applications. Drivers are
chinks in that wall. If a driver misbehaves or fails, there's a strong
possibility that it will cause unexpected behavior or kill the entire
system. It's absolutely critical that drivers not only be very carefully
tested before being released to the public, but that they follow the
rules to the letter.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_KernelSpacevsUserSpace"></a>Kernel Space vs. User Space</h4></div></div></div><p>One way you can reduce the risk of your driver causing a general system
failure is by putting as much code as possible in user space. Create a
driver that loads into kernel space just enough code to handle the
low-level interactions that absolutely have to be done in kernel space,
then load code into user space to handle the rest of the work. If the
add-on fails, the system will keep running—only your driver will
fail.</p><p>Another plus to placing as much of your code as possible into user space
is that it's much easier to debug code running in user space.
Conventional debugging techniques that don't work for kernel code can be
applied, and there's much less chance of taking down the system in the
process.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_CodeSynchronization"></a>Code Synchronization</h4></div></div></div><p>Normally, spinlocks are a bad thing. A spinlock is a tight loop that
watches for a condition to occur, looping endlessly until that condition
is met (this is called "busy waiting"). This wastes valuable processor
time, and is normally discouraged.</p><p>In general, you're encouraged to use semaphores instead of spinlocks;
however, you can't acquire a semaphore while handling an interrupt. So if
you need to synchronize code while handling an interrupt, you must use a
spinlock. Put simply:</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>Use spinlocks to protect critical sections in interrupt-handling code.</p></li><li><p>Use semaphores in any other situation that calls for code
synchronization.</p></li></ul><p>Anywhere you use a spinlock to protect a critical section, you should
disable interrupts. Of course, in an interrupt handler, you know that
interrupts are already disabled, so you don't need to explicitly disable
interrupts yourself. Interrupt handlers include I/O interrupts installed
using <code class="function">install_io_interrupt()</code> and timer interrupts installed by calling
<code class="function">add_timer()</code>.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_FunctionsAvailableDuringSpinlocks"></a>Functions Available During Spinlocks</h5></div></div></div><p>While your spinlock is running, you can perform the following actions. If
it's not on this list, you can't do it.</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>You can examine and alter hardware registers by using the appropriate
bus manager hooks.</p></li><li><p>You can examine and alter any locked-down memory.</p></li><li><p>You can call the following kernel functions:
<code class="function">system_time()</code>,
<code class="function">atomic_add()</code>, <code class="function">atomic_or()</code>,
<code class="function">atomic_and()</code>.</p></li><li><p>You can call the following bus manager functions:
<code class="function">read_io_*()</code> and
<code class="function">write_io*()</code>.</p></li></ul><p>If you do anything else inside your spinlock, you're breaking the rules,
so don't do it.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_UsingSpinlocks"></a>Using Spinlocks</h5></div></div></div><p>You need to be sure that your calls to <code class="function">acquire_spinlock()</code> and
<code class="function">release_spinlock()</code> are balanced. In addition, if you nest spinlocks, they
must be released in logical order—that is, in the opposite order in
which they're acquired.</p><p>The kernel keeps track of which spinlocks are being held and which are
being waited upon. The kernel assumes that spinlocks are initialized to
0, and then acquired and released in logical order.</p><p>By keeping track of spinlocks, the kernel can detect and break deadlocks
on multiprocessor systems.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_DisablingInterrupts"></a>Disabling Interrupts</h4></div></div></div><p>The only time you should ever disable interrupts in a device driver is
just before entering a spinlock-protected critical section. There is
absolutely no other reason to do it, so don't.</p><p>After disabling interrupts, you should reenable them as quickly as
possible. You must never, under any circumstances, leave interrupts
disabled for more than 50 microseconds. This means that your interrupt
handler code (which runs with interrupts implicitly disabled) must
execute in 50 microseconds or less.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_FunctionsAvailableWhileInterruptsAreDisabled"></a>Functions Available While Interrupts Are Disabled</h5></div></div></div><p>If you have interrupts disabled and aren't in a spinlock, you can do the
following things in addition to those listed above in "Functions
Available During Spinlocks":</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>You can call <code class="function">release_sem_etc()</code> with the
<code class="constant">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</code> flag set.</p></li><li><p>You can call <code class="function">get_sem_count()</code>, <code class="function">add_timer()</code>,
<code class="function">cancel_timer()</code>, and <code class="function">dprintf()</code>.</p></li></ul><p>If you feel that you need to call a function not explicitly listed as
permitted here, please contact Be Developer Support at devsupport@be.com
and explain your needs; we'd be happy to discuss the situation with you.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_DontBlock"></a>Don't Block</h5></div></div></div><p>It's crucial that your interrupt handler never block, whether directly
(by acquiring a semaphore, for example) or indirectly (by calling a
function that might block).</p><p>Blocking can happen in a surprisingly large number of BeOS functions.
It's obvious that <code class="function">acquire_sem()</code> can block, but you
might not be aware that functions such as <code class="function">malloc()</code> or
<code class="function">read_port()</code> can block. Even touching unlocked memory
areas can block because of virtual memory hits.</p><p>The point is this: If the BeOS function you want to call isn't explicitly
listed in this section as one you can use, don't call it.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_DontPreempt"></a>Don't Preempt</h5></div></div></div><p>Your interrupt handler or spinlock section can't be preempted.
Preemption could occur if you call <code class="function">release_sem()</code> or
<code class="function">release_sem_etc()</code> without specifying the
<code class="constant">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</code> flag. Normally,
<code class="function">release_sem()</code> lets the scheduler preempt your thread
to allow other threads to acquire the semaphore as fast as possible. By
specifying <code class="constant">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</code>, you tell the scheduler
to allow your thread to continue running after it releases the
semaphore.</p><p>If your interrupt handler wants to ensure that any preemption is
handled immediately, it should specify
<code class="constant">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</code> when calling
<code class="function">release_sem()</code>, then return
<code class="constant">B_INVOKE_SCHEDULER</code>. This causes the scheduler to
immediately handle preemption after your interrupt handler returns, instead
of resuming the interrupted task. This is especially useful if your code
called <code class="function">release_sem_etc()</code> to release a semaphore that
will allow other code to run elsewhere (such as in your driver's
corresponding user-space code).</p><div class="admonition warning"><div class="title">Warning</div><div class="graphic"><img class="icon" alt="Warning" width="32" src="./images/admonitions/Stop_32.png" /><div class="text"><p>Again, when you call <code class="function">release_sem_etc()</code>, be sure
to specify the <code class="constant">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</code> flag to avoid any
chance of preemption.</p></div></div></div><p>In summary, the order in which you should do things is this:</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>Disable interrupts.</p></li><li><p>Acquire the spinlock.</p></li><li><p>Perform your tasks.</p></li><li><p>Release the spinlock.</p></li><li><p>Restore the original interrupt state.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_FileIO"></a>File I/O</h5></div></div></div><p>Sometimes a driver needs to be able to access disk files. Perhaps the
driver has a preference file it needs to read. There are two ways to do
this. You can use Posix I/O calls, or you can use the driver settings API
provided by BeOS. The latter is preferred.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h6 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_UsingPosixCalls"></a>Using Posix Calls</h6></div></div></div><p>Under BeOS, device drivers can access disk files using the standard
low-level Posix I/O functions: <code class="function">open()</code>, <code class="function">close()</code>,
<code class="function">read()</code>, <code class="function">write()</code>, and so
forth. There aren't any special chores to attend to beforehand. Just
<code class="function">open()</code> the file and do your thing.</p><p>Two Posix extensions that might be helpful when you're writing code to
perform file I/O from a device driver: <code class="function">readv()</code>
and <code class="function">writev()</code>.</p><pre class="programlisting example c"><span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">readv</code>(<span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">fd</code>, <span class="type">const struct iovec*</span><code class="parameter">vector</code>, <span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="parameter">count</code>);

<span class="type">int</span> <code class="function">writev</code>(<span class="type">int</span> <code class="parameter">fd</code>, <span class="type">const struct iovec*</span><code class="parameter">vector</code>, <span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="parameter">count</code>);

<span class="type">struct iovec</span> {
   <span class="type">__ptr_t</span> <code class="varname">iov_base</code>;
   <span class="type">size_t</span> <code class="varname">iov_len</code>;
};</pre><p>These functions provide a means to read and write contiguous portions of
a file from multiple buffers. vector is a pointer to an array containing
count vector records, each of which contains a pointer to a buffer, and
the size of the buffer. <code class="function">readv()</code> fills these buffers with data from the
file, and <code class="function">writev()</code> writes them to the file, in order.</p><p>When successful, <code class="function">readv()</code> returns the number of bytes read.</p><p>For example, if your code needs to write two separate 1k buffers into a
file, one after the other, you might do something like this:</p><pre class="programlisting example c"><span class="type">struct iovec</span> <code class="varname">v</code>[2];
<code class="varname">v</code>[0].<code class="varname">iov_base</code> = &amp;<code class="varname">buffer1</code>;
<code class="varname">v</code>[0].<code class="varname">iov_len</code> = 1024;
<code class="varname">v</code>[1].<code class="varname">iov_base</code> = &amp;<code class="varname">buffer2</code>;
<code class="varname">v</code>[1].<code class="varname">iov_len</code> = 1024;

   <span class="comment">/* error */</span>
}</pre><p>Performing vectored I/O like this is often faster than doing multiple
calls to <code class="function">read()</code> and <code class="function">write()</code>.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h6 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DeviceDrivers_Introduction_TheDriverSettingsAPI"></a>The Driver Settings API</h6></div></div></div><p>If your driver is loaded before the file system for the disk on which
