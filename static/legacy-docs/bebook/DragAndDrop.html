kit, and you'll need to be at least reasonably familiar with the
following topics, in order to be comfortable reading this document:</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>The <a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
class, since dragged objects are sent to their targets
as <a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
objects. You should understand what a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
is, how to add data to a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
or extract data from it, how to send a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>,
and where to put code to handle incoming
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>s.</p></li><li><p>The <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
class. The drag and drop action is fundamentally a
<acronym class="acronym" title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>
operation, and
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
objects are the most important objects in handling
<acronym class="acronym">GUI</acronym> events; subclasses of
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
are where you will most often define
code to both initiate a drag, and handle a drop.</p></li><li><p>The Translation Kit, if you wish to make use of the BeOS' built-in
translation abilities to (for example) drag a
<acronym class="acronym" title="Joint Photographics Expert Group">JPEG</acronym> image from an
application, to another application that only understands raw bitmaps.</p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DragAndDrop_SimplevsNegotiated"></a>Simple vs. Negotiated Drag'n'Drop</h3></div></div></div><p>Roughly speaking, you can do two different kinds of drag and drop
operations; both appear the same to the user, but they differ in the
complexity of the background communication between the source of the
drag, and the drop target.</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id543251"></a>Simple Drag'n'Drop</h4></div></div></div><p>A simple drag'n'drop is one where the action of dragging and dropping
corresponds internally to a single
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
being sent, from the origin
of the drag to the drop target. This was the original drag'n'drop
protocol for the BeOS, and is still highly useful in dragging and
dropping which takes place within a single application, or within a
tightly coupled set of applications which "know about" one another. For
example, you could drag around drawing elements of a drawing program
using this protocol; each drag operation would result in the drawing
application sending a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
within itself, and that
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a> would
contain the data necessary to indicate which drawing element had been
moved, and to where. Using the built in drag'n'drop abilities of the BeOS
in this manner will lessen your own workload, since many of the most
basic aspects, such as visually dragging a bitmap around on the screen,
are handled automatically.</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DragAndDrop_Negotiated"></a>Negotiated Drag'n'Drop</h4></div></div></div><p>A negotiated drag and drop is used in a more general context, when the
originator of a drag and the receiver (drop target) of that drag do not
necessarily know anything about one another. This more general
drag'n'drop is necessary if we wish to make usage of the BeOS,
particularly it's media-related applications, as intuitive to the user as
possible. For example, the user should expect to be able to drag an image
from one graphics program (say a viewer) to another graphics program
(such as a paint program) with no difficulty. However, there are many
different underlying data formats for representing images, and the two
graphics programs will have to negotiate (with the aid of the Translation
kit) for the most suitable or desirable format.</p><p>Note that the negotiated drag'n'drop protocol is not a "hard and fast"
requirement; it is not enforced by the system, and could easily be
modified; for example, you might need a particularly complex negotiation
that takes more steps than defined in the standard. The major user of
negotiated drag'n'drop you are likely to encounter right now is in
Tracker, and we will talk about that in more detail later. Other
applications may support negotiated drag'n'drop or may not. Also note
that a simpler protocol was originally defined, and may still be used by
older applications. It's easy to make your code handle this older
protocol; see the later section on
"<a class="link" href="DragAndDrop.html#DragAndDrop_HandlingDropsFromOldApplications" title="Handling Drops from 'Old' Applications">Handling
the Old Drag'n'Drop Protocol</a>".</p></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DragAndDrop_Basics"></a>Basics of Drag and Drop</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's assume the user is working with two applications, and is going to
drag something from the first application (which we'll call the sender
application) to the second application (which we'll call the receiver
application.) In a nutshell, here are the steps that make up this entire
process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>Detection: Code in a
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
object of the sender application notices
that the user has clicked on something of interest, and started dragging
it. The monitoring code that notices this is usually spread out between
the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_MouseDown" title="MouseDown()"><code class="methodname">BView::MouseDown()</code></a>
and
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_MouseMoved" title="MouseMoved()"><code class="methodname">BView::MouseMoved()</code></a>
functions, and typically
has to differentiate between the start of a real drag and drop, or a
click that might (for example) select an object without dragging it, but
that moves just one or two pixels because the user has a slightly jittery
hand. The drag detection code will typically have to use
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_SetMouseEventMask"><code class="methodname">BView::SetMouseEventMask()</code></a>
to temporarily enable full reporting of mouse
movement (which is not normally reported to the application, for
efficiency reasons).</p></li><li><p>Initiation: Once the sender application's detection code has
decided a drag and drop action has been started, it initiates the drag
and drop internally, by creating a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
object containing information
about the nature of the object being dragged, and then passing that
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a> to the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DragMessage" title="DragMessage()"><code class="methodname">BView::DragMessage()</code></a>
function.
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_DragMessage" title="DragMessage()"><code class="methodname">BView::DragMessage()</code></a> also
determines how the object being dragged appears visually to the user; you
can pass it a
<a class="link" href="BBitmap.html" title="BBitmap"><code class="classname">BBitmap</code></a>,
in which case it will drag a cool picture around
the screen, or you can pass it a
<a class="link" href="BRect.html" title="BRect"><code class="classname">BRect</code></a>,
in which case it will drag a
boring old rectangular outline. After calling
<code class="methodname">DragMessage()</code>, the sender's
code should remember to delete its own copy of the
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>. Note: The
sender should not delete the
<a class="link" href="BBitmap.html" title="BBitmap"><code class="classname">BBitmap</code></a>
it passes to <code class="methodname">DragMessage()</code>; this will
be done by the system</p></li><li><p>Drag: This is the easy part; once the sender application has
initiated the drag, as described in the previous step, dragging a visual
representation around the screen is handled by the system. The next time
application code is invoked is on the . . .</p></li><li><p>Drop: The user releases the mouse button while the mouse is in a
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
of the receiver application. This causes the
<a class="link" href="BView.html#BView_MessageReceived" title="MessageReceived()"><code class="methodname">MessageReceived()</code></a>
function of the recipient <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
to be invoked, with the dragged
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
as its received message. This is the first of three
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a> objects that
can be sent as part of a single drag and drop action. We'll call this
first message the drag message. In a simple drag'n'drop, the drag message
can contain just about anything you want it to; since both the sender and
the receiver "know about" one another, they presumably have a common
private protocol, and the receiver can analyze the message and do
whatever is required. In a negotiated drag'n'drop, the drag message does
not typically carry the data that defines the object being dropped; for
example, if you drop a block of text, the message that is dropped
normally does not contain the text that was dragged. Instead, the drag
message contains information about the different formats and methods by
which the sender application may supply the data to the receiver
application, and about which actions the receiver application can request
of the sender application.</p></li><li><p>Negotiation [optional, used in negotiated drag'n'drop]: The
receiver application replies to the drag message with a second message,
which is dispatched back to the sender application using the
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html#BMessage_SendReply" title="SendReply()"><code class="methodname">BMessage::SendReply()</code></a>
function. We'll call this second message the
negotiation message. The receiver creates the negotiation message by
looking through the options supplied by the sender in the drag message,
choosing one or more, and including those option in the message so that
the sender will know which of its possible replies is actually desired.
The negotiation message also contains information about what the receiver
would like the sender to do with the dragged data; for example, if you
drag a file to the Trash, the negotiation message sent back "from" the
Trash will include a request that the sender delete the dragged data.</p></li><li><p>Data Transmission [optional, used in negotiated drag'n'drop]: The
sender examines the negotiation message sent back to it by the receiver,
to find out which available data format the receiver wants the data in.
The sender then packages up the data, and dispatches it off to the
receiver in the data message. (Optionally, the sender can, at the request
of the receiver, create a file through which it passes the data to the
receiver, rather than passing the data directly in the BMessage. We'll
talk about this when we discuss the details of the drop, negotiation, and
data messages.)</p></li><li><p>Completion [optional, used in negotiated drag'n'drop]: The receiver
gets the data message from the sender, extracts the desired data, and
uses it in whatever way it wants.</p></li></ol></div><p>This sounds more complex than it is. A picture is worth a thousand words,
so here is a simplified schematic of the process:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/drag_drop_schematic.png" alt="Drag And Drop Schematic" /></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DragAndDrop_Example"></a>Example: Simple Drag'n'Drop</h3></div></div></div><p>Before going on to more complex matters, let's see just how simple
"simple" drag'n'drop can be. The code below defines a very simple
application, which lets one drag around a black square in a window. The
application is both the sender (i.e., you click on the square in the
application window to start the drag), and the receiver (you release the
mouse button within the application window, to reposition the square).
Most of the program code is "boilerplate", similar to what would be found
in any application involving a
<a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>.
Those parts of the code pertaining

<code class="varname">be:type_descriptions</code> Fields</h6></div></div></div><p>The main purpose of negotiated drag'n'drop is to come up with an optimal
compromise between the data formats the sender application can provide
something in, and the data formats the receiver can accept that data in.
Accordingly, the three most important message fields in the drag message
are the <code class="varname">be:types</code>
and <code class="varname">be:filetypes</code>
fields; <code class="varname">be:type_descriptions</code>
accompanies the <code class="varname">be:filetypes</code> field, so we'll describe it here also.
Each of these fields is filled with a list of string values.</p><p>Values for these fields will typically be obtained from the Translation
Kit, by asking the Translation Kit which data formats it can provide the
dragged data in, and filling the fields in with the information returned
by the calls to the Translation Kit. (For example, if appropriate
translators are installed on the system, the Translation Kit might be
able to translate a bitmap into any of
<acronym class="acronym" title="Joint Photographics Expert Group">JPEG</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</acronym>,
<acronym class="acronym" title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym>, or
<acronym class="acronym" title="Tagged Image File Format">TIFF</acronym> images.)</p><p>The specific meanings of these three fields are as follows:</p><table class="variablelist fields"><thead><tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="varname">be:types</code></span></p></td><td><p>each value in this field indicates a data format the
sender is willing to provide its sent data in. This is a string value
(a MIME string, actually), but you won't normally need to know what the
string actually is, since you'll obtain it from the Translation Kit, or
from a predefined constant. If <code class="varname">be:types</code> consists of a single element
whose value is equal to that in the global variable <code class="constant">B_FILE_MIME_TYPE</code>,
then the sender application is not willing to provide its data in a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>;
the receiver must accept the data through a file, in one of
the formats specified in the <code class="varname">be:filetypes</code> field of this message. If
you want to indicate that your application is willing to send its data
via either of a <a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
or a file, then add <code class="constant">B_FILE_MIME_TYPE</code> as the
last element of <code class="varname">be:types</code>, after all of the types which can be sent in
a <a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="varname">be:filetypes</code></span></p></td><td><p>Similar <code class="varname">be:types</code>, but a values in this field
indicate formats in which the sender is willing to provide its data via
a file. This can make a lot of sense; for example, if what the user is
dragging around is a 30 megabyte video clip, you probably don't want to
pass this in a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>.
In most cases, <code class="varname">be:filetypes</code> will be
identical to <code class="varname">be:types</code>. If your application isn't willing to pass data
via a file, then it doesn't matter what (if anything) you put into
<code class="varname">be:filetypes</code>.</p><div class="admonition important"><div class="title">Important</div><div class="graphic"><img class="icon" alt="Important" width="32" src="./images/admonitions/Warning_32.png" /><div class="text"><p>See the section below in

format of the sent data, but also the action performed on that data.
Should the data be copied from the sender to the receiver, moved from the
sender to the receiver, or something else? The first part of this
"actions negotiation" takes place in the drag message via the
<code class="varname">be:actions</code> field.</p><p><code class="varname">be:actions</code> contains a list of values (32-bit integers actually) which
define the actions the sender is will to perform at the request of the
receiver. No action will actually be carried out until and unless the
receiver requests it. The possible action requests are given by the
following constants:</p><table class="variablelist constants"><thead><tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><span class="term"><code class="constant">B_COPY_TARGET</code></span></p></td><td><p>The sender is willing to provide a copy of the

result.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In addition to the above four "standard" actions, there are a few actions

a drag message. Then you receive a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>.
Is it the reply to your
original message? And if so, how do you access data about the original
drag (such as where the mouse was clicked) you might need in order to
complete the data message? Since the original drag message was sent
asynchronously, your application went merrily on its way immediately
after sending, and no longer remembers what the heck it dragged off
before. What do you do? This is where <code class="varname">be:originator</code> and
<code class="varname">be:originator_data</code> come in.</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p><code class="varname">be:originator</code> should be filled in with something that identifies

you'll need to use later on in the drag'n'drop negotiation. This could
be something as simple as the mouse position, or it could be a much
more complex piece of information about the context of the application
at the time the drag was started. It's up to you, and of course, you
don't have to use <code class="varname">be:orginator_data</code> at all.</p></li></ul><p>If you fill in <code class="varname">be:originator</code>

receives a <a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>
that may be a negotiation message responding to a
previously sent (asynchronous) drag message:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li><p>Your app checks to ensure that the incoming message has the correct

to obtain the original message; the message the
incoming message was sent in reply to.</p></li><li><p>Now, your app can examine <code class="varname">be:originator</code> in the original message,
to see if it recognizes that value as indicating a drag message sent out
by itself. If it does, then the incoming <code class="classname">BMessage</code> is in fact a
negotiation message in response to your original drag message; your app
can extract necessary context data from <code class="varname">be:originator_data</code>, and go on

amounts of data in a drag'n'drop operation, you may prefer to do so via a
file.</p><p>As far as passing data by a file goes, the sender application can
indicate one of two things when sending the drag message to the receiver:</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>The sender can offer to pass the data in a file, as well as via a
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html" title="BMessage"><code class="classname">BMessage</code></a>.

by a value in the drag message's <code class="varname">be:types</code>
field of <code class="constant">B_FILE_MIME_TYPE</code>. If
<code class="constant">B_FILE_MIME_TYPE</code> is the first entry in the

<code class="varname">be:types</code>
will be ignored; if there are entries in <code class="varname">be:types</code> before a value of
<code class="constant">B_FILE_MIME_TYPE</code>, then those entries are types with which the sender is

in <code class="varname">be:types</code>, that it is willing to pass data via a file, then the

sender application, it examines the data message in that message, to
ascertain what actions the sender application can carry out, and how it
can provide the desired data in the final drag message. Using this
information, the receiver application formulates the negotiation message,

indicated the actions the sender was willing to perform upon the dragged
data. The allowable actions (at the time of this writing—further actions
may be added in the future) are given by the following constants:</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p><code class="constant">B_COPY_TARGET</code></p></li><li><p><code class="constant">B_MOVE_TARGET</code></p></li><li><p><code class="constant">B_LINK_TARGET</code></p></li><li><p><code class="constant">B_TRASH_TARGET</code></p></li><li><p><code class="constant">B_MOVE_SELECTION_TO</code> (for Tracker drags only.)</p></li><li><p><code class="constant">B_COPY_SELECTION_TO</code> (for Tracker drags only.)</p></li></ul><p>When constructing the negotiation message, the receiver application will
choose one of the actions listed in the data message's <code class="varname">be:types</code> message
field (remember, not all allowable actions will necessarily be listed in
this message field), and use that action as the value of the what member
in the negotiation message. This will inform the sender application of

and will remain available.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Of course, you can leave out fields that don't apply to a particular
action. For example, if the receiver chooses <code class="constant">B_TRASH_TARGET</code> as the action
(by putting a value of <code class="constant">B_TRASH_TARGET</code> into the <code class="varname">what</code> member of the
negotiation message), no message fields are required; in fact, the sender
doesn't even need to respond to a request of <code class="constant">B_TRASH_TARGET</code> with a data
message, it simply has to delete the dragged data.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="DragAndDrop_ProtocolForTheDataMessage"></a>Protocol for the Data Message</h4></div></div></div><p>The data message is the third and final message sent as part of a
negotiated drag'n'drop. It is sent in response to a negotiation message,
using the
<a class="link" href="BMessage.html#BMessage_SendReply" title="SendReply()"><code class="methodname">BMessage::SendReply()</code></a>
function, and is sent only if the sender
application has elected to pass the dragged data directly in a message.
If the sender application passes data to the receiver via a file, no data
message is sent. [xxx just want to check, is this correct? It would seem
you'd want to at least send confirmation that the write was successful.
Or should the receiver just do a node monitor kind of thing?]</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id545816"></a>When Data Is Sent in the Data Message</h5></div></div></div><p>If the sender elects to send the dragged data directly in the data

being sent, and whose contents consist of the data itself. For example,
if you drag some text from one text processing window to another, the
final data message (after the drop and negotiation messages have been
sent) might contain a message field named "text/plain", which contains
the text being dragged. Alternatively, if you dragged text from an HTML
viewer, the data message might (depending on the negotiations) have a
single field called "text/html", which would contain the text including
the html formatting statements.</p></li></ul><p>Note that when the data messages arrives at the receiver, it may contain
more than the single message field described above; other message fields
might be added automatically, by parts of the system. However, the
